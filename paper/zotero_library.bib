	title = {Fast, Exact Bootstrap Principal Component Analysis for p{\textgreater}1 million},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0922},
	abstract = {Many have suggested a bootstrap procedure for estimating the sampling variability of principal component analysis ({PCA}) results. However, when the number of measurements per subject (\$p\$) is much larger than the number of subjects (\$n\$), the challenge of calculating and storing the leading principal components from each bootstrap sample can be computationally infeasible. To address this, we outline methods for fast, exact calculation of bootstrap principal components, eigenvalues, and scores. Our methods leverage the fact that all bootstrap samples occupy the same \$n\$-dimensional subspace as the original sample. As a result, all bootstrap principal components are limited to the same \$n\$-dimensional subspace and can be efficiently represented by their low dimensional coordinates in that subspace. Several uncertainty metrics can be computed solely based on the bootstrap distribution of these low dimensional coordinates, without calculating or storing the \$p\$-dimensional bootstrap components. Fast bootstrap {PCA} is applied to a dataset of sleep electroencephalogram ({EEG}) recordings (\$p=900\$, \$n=392\$), and to a dataset of brain magnetic resonance images ({MRIs}) (\$p{\textbackslash}approx\$ 3 million, \$n=352\$). For the brain {MRI} dataset, our method allows for standard errors for the first 3 principal components based on 1000 bootstrap samples to be calculated on a standard laptop in 47 minutes, as opposed to approximately 4 days with standard methods.},

Together these visualisations facilitate substantial insights into the roles of covariates in a random forest but do not communicate the frequencies of the hierarchies of covariates effects across the random forest or the orders in which covariates occur in these hierarchies. Our visualisations address these gaps. We demonstrate our visualisations using a random forest fitted to publicly available data and provide a software implementation in the form of an R package.},

	abstract = {The extraction of information from multiple sets of data is a problem inherent to many disciplines. This is possible by either analyzing the data sets jointly as in data fusion or separately and then combining as in data integration. However, selecting the optimal method to combine and analyze multiset data is an ever-present challenge. The primary reason for this is the difficulty in determining the optimal contribution of each data set to an analysis as well as the amount of potentially exploitable complementary information among data sets. In this paper, we propose a novel classification rate-based technique to unambiguously quantify the contribution of each data set to a fusion result as well as facilitate direct comparisons of fusion methods on real data and apply a new method, independent vector analysis ({IVA}), to multiset fusion. This classification rate-based technique is used on functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from 121 patients with schizophrenia and 150 healthy controls during the performance of three tasks. Through this application, we find that though optimal performance is achieved by exploiting all tasks, each task does not contribute equally to the result and this framework enables effective quantification of the value added by each task. Our results also demonstrate that data fusion methods are more powerful than data integration methods, with the former achieving a classification rate of 73.5 \% and the latter achieving one of 70.9 \%, a difference which we show is significant when all three tasks are analyzed together. Finally, we show that {IVA}, due to its flexibility, has equivalent or superior performance compared with the popular data fusion method, joint independent component analysis.},

	abstract = {"Mixed Data" comprising a large number of heterogeneous variables (e.g. count, binary, continuous, skewed continuous, among other data types) are prevalent in varied areas such as genomics and proteomics, imaging genetics, national security, social networking, and Internet advertising. There have been limited efforts at statistically modeling such mixed data jointly, in part because of the lack of computationally amenable multivariate distributions that can capture direct dependencies between such mixed variables of different types. In this paper, we address this by introducing a novel class of Block Directed Markov Random Fields ({BDMRFs}). Using the basic building block of node-conditional univariate exponential families from Yang et al. (2012), we introduce a class of mixed conditional random field distributions, that are then chained according to a block-directed acyclic graph to form our class of Block Directed Markov Random Fields ({BDMRFs}). The Markov independence graph structure underlying a {BDMRF} thus has both directed and undirected edges. We introduce conditions under which these distributions exist and are normalizable, study several instances of our models, and propose scalable penalized conditional likelihood estimators with statistical guarantees for recovering the underlying network structure. Simulations as well as an application to learning mixed genomic networks from next generation sequencing expression data and mutation data demonstrate the versatility of our methods.},

	abstract = {Due to the dynamic, condition-dependent nature of brain activity, interest in estimating rapid functional connectivity ({FC}) changes that occur during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-{fMRI}) has recently soared. However, studying dynamic {FC} is methodologically challenging, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the blood oxygen level dependent ({BOLD}) signal in {fMRI} and the massive number of data points generated during the analysis. Thus, it is important to establish methods and summary measures that maximize reliability and the utility of dynamic {FC} to provide insight into brain function. In this study, we investigated the reliability of dynamic {FC} summary measures derived using three commonly used estimation methods - sliding window ({SW}), tapered sliding window ({TSW}), and dynamic conditional correlations ({DCC}) methods. We applied each of these techniques to two publicly available rs-{fMRI} test-retest data sets - the Multi-Modal {MRI} Reproducibility Resource (Kirby Data) and the Human Connectome Project ({HCP} Data). The reliability of two categories of dynamic {FC} summary measures were assessed, specifically basic summary statistics of the dynamic correlations and summary measures derived from recurring whole-brain patterns of {FC} (“brain states”). The results provide evidence that dynamic correlations are reliably detected in both test-retest data sets, and the {DCC} method outperforms {SW} methods in terms of the reliability of summary statistics. However, across all estimation methods, reliability of the brain state-derived measures was low. Notably, the results also show that the {DCC}-derived dynamic correlation variances are significantly more reliable than those derived using the non-parametric estimation methods. This is important, as the fluctuations of dynamic {FC} (i.e., its variance) has a strong potential to provide summary measures that can be used to find meaningful individual differences in dynamic {FC}. We therefore conclude that utilizing the variance of the dynamic connectivity is an important component in any dynamic {FC}-derived summary measure.},

The appeal of the cleverness of the procedure seems to replace the need for a rigorous argument that it produces valid hypothesis tests. The consequence of this educational failing has been a widespread belief in a “permutation principle”, which is supposed invariably to give tests that are valid by construction, under an absolute minimum of statistical assumptions. Several lines of argument are presented here to show that the permutation principle itself can be invalid, concentrating on the Fisher-Pitman permutation test for two means. A simple counterfactual example illustrates the general problem, and a slightly more elaborate counterfactual argument is used to explain why the main mathematical proof of the validity of permutation tests is mistaken. Two modifications of the permutation test are suggested to be valid in a very modest simulation. In instances where simulation software is readily available, investigating the validity of a specific permutation test can be done easily, requiring only a minimum understanding of statistical technicalities.},

At the same time, and despite widely publicized controversy, P-values remain the most commonly used measure to statistically justify relationships identified between variables. Here we measure the ability to detect statistically significant relationships from scatterplots in a randomized trial of 2,039 students in a statistics massive open online course ({MOOC}). Each subject was shown a random set of scatterplots and asked to visually determine if the underlying relationships were statistically significant at the P {\textless} 0.05 level. Subjects correctly classified only 47.4\% (95\% {CI} [45.1\%–49.7\%]) of statistically significant relationships, and 74.6\% (95\% {CI} [72.5\%–76.6\%]) of non-significant relationships. Adding visual aids such as a best fit line or scatterplot smooth increased the probability a relationship was called significant, regardless of whether the relationship was actually significant. Classification of statistically significant relationships improved on repeat attempts of the survey, although classification of non-significant relationships did not. Our results suggest: (1) that evidence-based data analysis can be used to identify weaknesses in theoretical procedures in the hands of average users, (2) data analysts can be trained to improve detection of statistically significant results with practice, but (3) data analysts have incorrect intuition about what statistically significant relationships look like, particularly for small effects.

	abstract = {One of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference ({VI}), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. {VI} has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind {VI} is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of {VI} applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in {VI} and highlight important open problems. {VI} is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

	abstract = {Information from historical trials is important for the design, interim monitoring, analysis, and interpretation of clinical trials. Meta-analytic models can be used to synthesize the evidence from historical data, which are often only available in aggregate form. We consider evidence synthesis methods for trials with recurrent event endpoints, which are common in many therapeutic areas. Such endpoints are typically analyzed by negative binomial regression. However, the individual patient data necessary to fit such a model are usually unavailable for historical trials reported in the medical literature. We describe approaches for back-calculating model parameter estimates and their standard errors from available summary statistics with various techniques, including approximate Bayesian computation. We propose to use a quadratic approximation to the log-likelihood for each historical trial based on 2 independent terms for the log mean rate and the log of the dispersion parameter. A Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis model then provides the posterior predictive distribution for these parameters. Simulations show this approach with back-calculated parameter estimates results in very similar inference as using parameter estimates from individual patient data as an input. We illustrate how to design and analyze a new randomized placebo-controlled exacerbation trial in severe eosinophilic asthma using data from 11 historical trials.},

	abstract = {A recent proposal to "redefine statistical significance" (Benjamin, et al. Nature Human Behaviour, 2017) claims that false positive rates "would immediately improve" by factors greater than two and replication rates would double simply by changing the conventional cutoff for 'statistical significance' from P{\textless}0.05 to P{\textless}0.005.  I analyze the veracity of these claims, focusing especially on how Benjamin, et al neglect the effects of P-hacking in assessing the impact of their proposal. My analysis shows that once P-hacking is accounted for the perceived benefits of the lower threshold all but disappear, prompting two main conclusions: (i) The claimed improvements to false positive rate and replication rate in Benjamin, et al (2017) are exaggerated and misleading. (ii) There are plausible scenarios under which the lower cutoff will make the replication crisis worse.},

However, it is often difficult to comprehend the available evidence because of the complex combination of interventions across trials, in addition to the limited search and retrieval tools available in databases such as {ClinicalTrials}.gov. Here we demonstrate the use of networks to visualize and quantitatively analyze the co-occurrence of drug interventions across trials on depression in {ClinicalTrials}.gov. The analysis identified general co-occurrence patterns of interventions across all depression trials, and specific co-occurrence patterns related to antidepressants and natural supplements. These results led to insights about the current state of depression trials, and to a graph-theoretic measure to categorize interventions for a disease. We conclude by discussing the opportunities and challenges of generalizing our approach to analyze comparative interventional studies for any disease.},

When covariate information on patients is available, logistic regression and other multivariate techniques are often used to select prognostic factors and create predictive models. An example shows how the explicit aim of prediction needs to be taken into account in such modelling, and how predictive performance may be assessed by decomposition of a scoring rule. Secondly, results from a program that provides pretrial and interim predictions in clinical trials are displayed, bringing together the use of subjective opinion, Bayesian methodology and techniques for evaluating and criticizing predictions.},

	abstract = {We study the application of a widely used ordinal regression model, the cumulative probability model ({CPM}), for continuous outcomes. Such models are attractive for the analysis of continuous response variables because they are invariant to any monotonic transformation of the outcome and because they directly model the cumulative distribution function from which summaries such as expectations and quantiles can easily be derived. Such models can also readily handle mixed type distributions. We describe the motivation, estimation, inference, model assumptions, and diagnostics. We demonstrate that {CPMs} applied to continuous outcomes are semiparametric transformation models. Extensive simulations are performed to investigate the finite sample performance of these models. We find that properly specified {CPMs} generally have good finite sample performance with moderate sample sizes, but that bias may occur when the sample size is small. Cumulative probability models are fairly robust to minor or moderate link function misspecification in our simulations. For certain purposes, the {CPMs} are more efficient than other models. We illustrate their application, with model diagnostics, in a study of the treatment of {HIV}. {CD}4 cell count and viral load 6 months after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy are modeled using {CPMs}; both variables typically require transformations, and viral load has a large proportion of measurements below a detection limit.},

	abstract = {A number of functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studies reported the existence of default mode network ({DMN}) and its disruption due to the presence of a disease such as Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). In this investigation, first, we used the independent component analysis ({ICA}) technique to confirm the {DMN} difference between patients with {AD} and normal control ({NC}) reported in previous studies. Consistent with the previous studies, the decreased resting-state functional connectivity of {DMN} in {AD} was identified in posterior cingulated cortex ({PCC}), medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}), inferior parietal cortex ({IPC}), inferior temporal cortex ({ITC}), and hippocampus ({HC}). Moreover, we introduced Bayesian network ({BN}) to study the effective connectivity of {DMN} and the difference between {AD} and {NC}. When compared the {DMN} effective connectivity in {AD} with the one in {NC} using a nonparametric random permutation test, we found that connections from left {HC} to left {IPC}, left {ITC} to right {HC}, right {HC} to left {IPC}, to {MPFC} and to {PCC} were all lost. In addition, in {AD} group, the connection directions between right {HC} and left {HC}, between left {HC} and left {ITC}, and between right {IPC} and right {ITC} were opposite to those in {NC} group. The connections of right {HC} to other regions, except left {HC}, within the {BN} were all statistically in-distinguishable from 0, suggesting an increased right hippocampal pathological and functional burden in {AD}. The altered effective connectivity in patients with {AD} may reveal more characteristics of the disease and may serve as a potential biomarker. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Using the mathematical framework of complex networks, these interaction patterns can be parsimoniously represented as brain graphs: each brain area is represented as a network node and each connection is represented as a network edge. These methods have been used to demonstrate that human brain networks display properties such as a small-world architecture that may directly facilitate cognitive processes. Moreover, mounting evidence suggests that these properties are altered in disease states, potentially providing important biomarkers for psychiatric and neurological disorders and informing our understanding of the mechanisms of altered cognitive function. Here, the basic concepts in network science are reviewed, and the properties of healthy and diseased brain networks discussed. Relationships between network diagnostics and alterations in behavioural or cognitive variables associated with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and epilepsy are highlighted.

Therefore, there is a strong need for accurate and sensitive tools for the early diagnoses of {AD}. The complex etiology and multiple pathogenesis of {AD} call for a system-level understanding of the currently available biomarkers and the study of new biomarkers via network-based modeling of heterogeneous data types. In this review, we summarize recent research on the study of {AD} as a connectivity syndrome. We argue that a network-based approach in biomarker discovery will provide key insights to fully understand the network degeneration hypothesis (disease starts in specific network areas and progressively spreads to connected areas of the initial loci-networks) with a potential impact for early diagnosis and disease-modifying treatments. We introduce a new framework for the quantitative study of biomarkers that can help shorten the transition between academic research and clinical diagnosis in {AD}.},

	abstract = {Background
Most pediatric kidney transplant recipients eventually require retransplantation, and the most advantageous timing strategy regarding deceased and living donor transplantation in candidates with only one living donor remains unclear.

Methods
A patient-oriented Markov decision process model was designed to compare, for a given patient with one living donor, living-donor-first followed if necessary by deceased donor retransplantation versus deceased-donor-first followed if necessary by living donor (if still able to donate) or deceased donor (if not) retransplantation. Based on Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data, the model was designed to account for waitlist, graft, and patient survival, sensitization, increased risk of graft failure seen during late adolescence, and differential deceased donor waiting times based upon pediatric-priority allocation policies. Based on national cohort data, the model was also designed to account for aging or disease development leading to ineligibility of the living donor over time.

Results
Given a set of candidate and living donor characteristics, the Markov model provides the expected patient survival over a time horizon of 20 years. For the most highly sensitized patients ({PRA}{\textgreater}80\%), a deceased-donor-first strategy was advantageous, but for all other patients ({PRA}{\textless}80\%), a living-donor-first strategy was recommended.

Conclusions
This Markov model illustrates how patients, families, and providers can be provided information and predictions regarding the most advantageous use of deceased donor versus living donor transplantation for pediatric recipients.},

We propose an additional ischemia time, extraction time, beginning with aortic cross-clamp and perfusion/cooling of the kidneys, and ending with removal of the kidneys and placement on ice on the backtable. During this time the kidneys rewarm, suffering an additional ischemic insult, which may impair transplant function. We measured extraction times of 576 kidneys recovered and transplanted locally between January 2006 and December 2008, then linked to Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients ({SRTR}) data for outcomes. Extraction time ranged from 14 to 123 min, with a mean of 44.7 min. In {SRTR}-adjusted analyses, longer extraction time and {DGF} were statistically associated (odds ratio [{OR}] = 1.19 per 5 min beyond 60 min, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.02–1.39, p = 0.03). Up to 60 min of extraction time, {DGF} incidence was 27.8\%; by 120 min it doubled to nearly 60\%. Although not statistically significant ({OR} = 1.19, 95\% {CI} 0.96–1.49, p = 0.11), primary nonfunction rate also rose dramatically to nearly 20\% by 120 min extraction time.

	abstract = {The use of the proportional odds ({PO}) model for ordinal regression is ubiquitous in the literature. If the assumption of parallel lines does not hold for the data, then an alternative is to specify a non-proportional odds ({NPO}) model, where the regression parameters are allowed to vary depending on the level of the response. However, it is often difficult to fit these models, and challenges regarding model choice and fitting are further compounded if there are a large number of explanatory variables. We make two contributions towards tackling these issues: firstly, we develop a Bayesian method for fitting these models, that ensures the stochastic ordering conditions hold for an arbitrary finite range of the explanatory variables, allowing {NPO} models to be fitted to any observed data set. Secondly, we use reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to allow the model to choose between {PO} and {NPO} structures for each explanatory variable, and show how variable selection can be incorporated. These methods can be adapted for any monotonic increasing link functions. We illustrate the utility of these approaches on novel data from a longitudinal study of individual-level risk factors affecting body condition score in a dog population in Zenzele, South Africa.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of Bayesian sample size determination for a clinical trial in the presence of historical data that inform the treatment effect. Our broadly applicable, simulation-based methodology provides a framework for calibrating the informativeness of a prior while simultaneously identifying the minimum sample size required for a new trial such that the overall design has appropriate power to detect a non-null treatment effect and reasonable type I error control. We develop a comprehensive strategy for eliciting null and alternative sampling prior distributions which are used to deﬁne Bayesian generalizations of the traditional notions of type I error control and power. Bayesian type I error control requires that a weighted-average type I error rate not exceed a prespeciﬁed threshold. We develop a procedure for generating an appropriately sized Bayesian hypothesis test using a simple partial-borrowing power prior which summarizes the fraction of information borrowed from the historical trial. We present results from simulation studies that demonstrate that a hypothesis test procedure based on this simple power prior is as efﬁcient as those based on more complicated meta-analytic priors, such as normalized power priors or robust mixture priors, when all are held to precise type I error control requirements. We demonstrate our methodology using a real data set to design a follow-up clinical trial with time-to-event endpoint for an investigational treatment in high-risk melanoma.},

	abstract = {Multivariate data occurs in a wide range of ﬁelds, with ever more ﬂexible model speciﬁcations being proposed, often within a multivariate generalised linear mixed eﬀects ({MGLME}) framework. In this article, we describe an extended framework, encompassing multiple outcomes of any type, each of which could be repeatedly measured (longitudinal), with any number of levels, and with any number of random eﬀects at each level. Many standard distributions are described, as well as nonstandard user-deﬁned non-linear models. The extension focuses on a complex linear predictor for each outcome model, allowing sharing and linking between outcome models in an extremely ﬂexible way, either by linking random eﬀects directly, or the expected value of one outcome (or function of it) within the linear predictor of another. Non-linear and time-dependent eﬀects are also seamlessly incorporated to the linear predictor through the use of splines or fractional polynomials. We further propose level-speciﬁc random eﬀect distributions and numerical integration techniques to improve usability, relaxing the normally distributed random eﬀects assumption to allow multivariate tdistributed random eﬀects. We consider some special cases of the general framework, describing some new models in the ﬁelds of clustered survival data, joint longitudinal-survival models, and discuss various potential uses of the implementation.

Bayesian analyses use available patient-outcome information, including biomarkers that accumulating data indicate might be related to clinical outcome. They also allow for the use of historical information and for synthesizing results of relevant trials.

	abstract = {Background The Bayesian approach is being used increasingly in medical research. In particular, it has become a standard in designing clinical trials at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.
Purpose/Methods To address the extent and nature of Bayesian trials conducted at M. D. Anderson, we reviewed the protocols registered in the Protocol Document Online System between 2000 and early 2005. We summarize our findings and give details for three innovative trials that typify those in which a Bayesian approach has played a major role at the center.
Results Of 964 protocols reviewed, 59\% were conducted solely at M. D. Anderson and the rest were multicenter trials. Bayesian designs and analyses were used in about 20\% (195/964) of the protocols that we reviewed. Of the 520 protocols identified as phase I or {II} drug trials, about 34\% were Bayesian. Most of the 195 Bayesian trials were designed by M. D. Anderson statisticians. The Bayesian design features most commonly used were the continuous reassessment method in phase I (toxicity) trials, adaptive randomization in phase {II} trials, and designs to monitor efficacy and toxicity simultaneously. We also provide an insider’s view regarding some practical considerations that have made the design and implementation of so many Bayesian trials possible. Limitations We reviewed only a subset of all M. D. Anderson protocols, but did not exclude any available in electronic form.
Conclusions The large number of Bayesian trials conducted at M. D. Anderson testifies to the receptivity to the Bayesian approach within the center, including principal investigators, regulatory review committees, and patients. Statisticians who take a Bayesian perspective can successfully work to establish a culture of innovation in clinical trial design. Clinical Trials 2009; 6: 205–216. http://ctj.sagepub.com},

Frequentist inference, and its null hypothesis significance testing ({NHST}), has been hegemonic through most of the history of scientific psychology. However, the {NHST} has not been exempt of criticisms. Therefore, the aim of this chapter is to introduce a Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing that may represent a useful complement, or even an alternative, to the current {NHST}. The advantages of this Bayesian approach over Frequentist {NHST} will be presented, providing examples that support its use in psychology and social sciences. Conclusions are outlined.},

The Bayesian framework provides a uniﬁed approach for incorporating prior information and/or uncertainties regarding the statistical model with a utility function which describes the experimental aims. In this paper, we provide a general overview on the concepts involved in Bayesian experimental design, and focus on describing some of the more commonly used Bayesian utility functions and methods for their estimation, as well as a number of algorithms that are used to search over the design space to ﬁnd the Bayesian optimal design.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE} To apply Bayesian decision analysis ({BDA}) to cancer therapeutics to choose an alpha and sample size that minimize the potential harm to current and future patients under both null and alternative hypotheses. {DATA} {SOURCES} We used the National Cancer Institute ({NCI}) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ({SEER}) database and data from the 10 clinical trials of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology. {STUDY} {SELECTION} The {NCI} {SEER} database was used because it is the most comprehensive cancer database in the United States. The Alliance trial data was used owing to the quality and breadth of data, and because of the expertise in these trials of one of us (D.J.S.). {DATA} {EXTRACTION} {AND} {SYNTHESIS} The {NCI} {SEER} and Alliance data have already been thoroughly vetted. Computations were replicated independently by 2 coauthors and reviewed by all coauthors. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES} Our prior hypothesis was that an alpha of 2.5\% would not minimize the overall expected harm to current and future patients for the most deadly cancers, and that a less conservative alpha may be necessary. Our primary study outcomes involve measuring the potential harm to patients under both null and alternative hypotheses using {NCI} and Alliance data, and then computing {BDA}-optimal type 1 error rates and sample sizes for oncology {RCTs}.
{RESULTS} We computed {BDA}-optimal parameters for the 23 most common cancer sites using {NCI} data, and for the 10 Alliance clinical trials. For {RCTs} involving therapies for cancers with short survival times, no existing treatments, and low prevalence, the {BDA}-optimal type 1 error rates were much higher than the traditional 2.5\%. For cancers with longer survival times, existing treatments, and high prevalence, the corresponding {BDA}-optimal error rates were much lower, in some cases even lower than 2.5\%.
{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE} Bayesian decision analysis is a systematic, objective, transparent, and repeatable process for deciding the outcomes of {RCTs} that explicitly incorporates burden of disease and patient preferences.},

	abstract = {Implicit in the drug-approval process is a host of decisions—target patient population, control group, primary endpoint, sample size, follow-up period, etc.—all of which determine the trade-oﬀ between Type I and Type {II} error. We explore the application of Bayesian decision analysis ({BDA}) to minimize the expected cost of drug approval, where the relative costs of the two types of errors are calibrated using U.S. Burden of Disease Study 2010 data. The results for conventional ﬁxed-sample randomized clinical-trial designs suggest that for terminal illnesses with no existing therapies such as pancreatic cancer, the standard threshold of 2.5\% is substantially more conservative than the {BDA}-optimal threshold of 23.9\% to 27.8\%. For relatively less deadly conditions such as prostate cancer, 2.5\% is more risk-tolerant or aggressive than the {BDA}-optimal threshold of 1.2\% to 1.5\%. We compute {BDA}-optimal sizes for 25 of the most lethal diseases and show how a {BDA}-informed approval process can incorporate all stakeholders’ views in a systematic, transparent, internally consistent, and repeatable manner.},

	abstract = {Univariate or multivariate ordinal responses are often assumed to arise from a latent continuous parametric distribution, with covariate effects which enter linearly. We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric modeling approach for univariate and multivariate ordinal regression, which is based on mixture modeling for the joint distribution of latent responses and covariates. The modeling framework enables highly flexible inference for ordinal regression relationships, avoiding assumptions of linearity or additivity in the covariate effects. In standard parametric ordinal regression models, computational challenges arise from identifiability constraints and estimation of parameters requiring nonstandard inferential techniques. A key feature of the nonparametric model is that it achieves inferential flexibility, while avoiding these difficulties. In particular, we establish full support of the nonparametric mixture model under fixed cut-off points that relate through discretization the latent continuous responses with the ordinal responses. The practical utility of the modeling approach is illustrated through application to two data sets from econometrics, an example involving regression relationships for ozone concentration, and a multirater agreement problem.},

In this paper, we propose empirical and fully Bayesian modifications of the commensurate prior model (Hobbs et al., 2011) extending Pocock (1976), and evaluate their frequentist and Bayesian properties for incorporating patient-level historical data using general and generalized linear mixed regression models. Our proposed commensurate prior models lead to preposterior admissible estimators that facilitate alternative bias-variance trade-offs than those offered by preexisting methodologies for incorporating historical data from a small number of historical studies.

However when prior and current information conflict, Bayesian methods can lead to higher than expected Type I error, as well as the possibility of a costlier and lengthier trial. This motivates an investigation of the feasibility of hierarchical Bayesian methods for incorporating historical data that are adaptively robust to prior information that reveals itself to be inconsistent with the accumulating experimental data. In this paper, we present several models that allow for the commensurability of the information in the historical and current data to determine how much historical information is used. A primary tool is elaborating the traditional power prior approach based upon a measure of commensurability for Gaussian data. We compare the frequentist performance of several methods using simulations, and close with an example of a colon cancer trial that illustrates a linear models extension of our adaptive borrowing approach. Our proposed methods produce more precise estimates of the model parameters, in particular conferring statistical significance to the observed reduction in tumor size for the experimental regimen as compared to the control regimen.},

	abstract = {Clinical trials rarely, if ever, occur in a vacuum. Generally, large amounts of clinical data are available prior to the start of a study, particularly on the current study’s control arm. There is obvious appeal in using (i.e., ‘borrowing’) this information. With historical data providing information on the control arm, more trial resources can be devoted to the novel treatment while retaining accurate estimates of the current control arm parameters. This can result in more accurate point estimates, increased power, and reduced type I error in clinical trials, provided the historical information is sufficiently similar to the current control data. If this assumption of similarity is not satisfied, however, one can acquire increased mean square error of point estimates due to bias and either reduced power or increased type I error depending on the direction of the bias. In this manuscript, we review several methods for historical borrowing, illustrating how key parameters in each method affect borrowing behavior, and then, we compare these methods on the basis of mean square error, power and type I error. We emphasize two main themes. First, we discuss the idea of ‘dynamic’ (versus ‘static’) borrowing. Second, we emphasize the decision process involved in determining whether or not to include historical borrowing in terms of the perceived likelihood that the current control arm is sufficiently similar to the historical data. Our goal is to provide a clear review of the key issues involved in historical borrowing and provide a comparison of several methods useful for practitioners.},

	abstract = {Randomized controlled studies are the gold standard for phase {III} clinical trials. Using α-spending functions to control the overall type I error rate, group sequential methods are well established and have been dominating phase {III} studies. Bayesian randomized design, on the other hand, can be viewed as a complement instead of competitive approach to the frequentist methods. For the ﬁxed Bayesian design, the hypothesis testing can be cast in the posterior probability or Bayes factor framework, which has a direct link to the frequentist type I error rate. Bayesian group sequential design relies upon Bayesian decision-theoretic approaches based on backward induction, which is often computationally intensive. Compared with the frequentist approaches, Bayesian methods have several advantages. The posterior predictive probability serves as a useful and convenient tool for trial monitoring, and can be updated at any time as the data accrue during the trial. The Bayesian decisiontheoretic framework possesses a direct link to the decision making in the practical setting, and can be modeled more realistically to reﬂect the actual cost–beneﬁt analysis during the drug development process. Other merits include the possibility of hierarchical modeling and the use of informative priors, which would lead to a more comprehensive utilization of information from both historical and longitudinal data. From ﬁxed to adaptive design, we focus on Bayesian randomized controlled clinical trials and make extensive comparisons with frequentist counterparts through numerical studies.},

	abstract = {Although the frequentist paradigm has been the predominant approach to clinical trial design since the 1940s, it has several notable limitations. The alternative Bayesian paradigm has been greatly enhanced by advancements in computational algorithms and computer hardware. Compared to its frequentist counterpart, the Bayesian framework has several unique advantages, and its incorporation into clinical trial design is occurring more frequently. Using an extensive literature review to assess how Bayesian methods are used in clinical trials, we find them most commonly used for dose finding, efficacy monitoring, toxicity monitoring, diagnosis/decision making, and for studying pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. The additional infrastructure required for implementing Bayesian methods in clinical trials may include specialized software programs to run the study design, simulation, and analysis, and Web-based applications, which are particularly useful for timely data entry and analysis. Trial success requires not only the development of proper tools but also timely and accurate execution of data entry, quality control, adaptive randomization, and Bayesian computation. The relative merit of the Bayesian and frequentist approaches continues to be the subject of debate in statistics. However, more evidence can be found showing the convergence of the two camps, at least at the practical level. Ultimately, better clinical trial methods lead to more efficient designs, lower sample sizes, more accurate conclusions, and better outcomes for patients enrolled in the trials. Bayesian methods offer attractive alternatives for better trials. More such trials should be designed and conducted to refine the approach and demonstrate its real benefit in action.},

	abstract = {Background: Bayesian statistics are an appealing alternative to the traditional frequentist approach to designing, analysing, and reporting of clinical trials, especially in rare diseases. Time-to-event endpoints are widely used in many medical fields. There are additional complexities to designing Bayesian survival trials which arise from the need to specify a model for the survival distribution. The objective of this article was to critically review the use and reporting of Bayesian methods in survival trials.
Methods: A systematic review of clinical trials using Bayesian survival analyses was performed through {PubMed} and Web of Science databases. This was complemented by a full text search of the online repositories of pre-selected journals. Cost-effectiveness, dose-finding studies, meta-analyses, and methodological papers using clinical trials were excluded.
Results: In total, 28 articles met the inclusion criteria, 25 were original reports of clinical trials and 3 were re-analyses of a clinical trial. Most trials were in oncology (n = 25), were randomised controlled (n = 21) phase {III} trials (n = 13), and half considered a rare disease (n = 13). Bayesian approaches were used for monitoring in 14 trials and for the final analysis only in 14 trials. In the latter case, Bayesian survival analyses were used for the primary analysis in four cases, for the secondary analysis in seven cases, and for the trial re-analysis in three cases. Overall, 12 articles reported fitting Bayesian regression models (semi-parametric, n = 3; parametric, n = 9). Prior distributions were often incompletely reported: 20 articles did not define the prior distribution used for the parameter of interest. Over half of the trials used only non-informative priors for monitoring and the final analysis (n = 12) when it was specified. Indeed, no articles fitting Bayesian regression models placed informative priors on the parameter of interest. The prior for the treatment effect was based on historical data in only four trials. Decision rules were pre-defined in eight cases when trials used Bayesian monitoring, and in only one case when trials adopted a Bayesian approach to the final analysis.
Conclusion: Few trials implemented a Bayesian survival analysis and few incorporated external data into priors. There is scope to improve the quality of reporting of Bayesian methods in survival trials. Extension of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement for reporting Bayesian clinical trials is recommended.},

By leveraging a mixture of low-rank factorizations, we allow simple global and local hypothesis testing adjusting for multiplicity. An eﬃcient Gibbs sampler is deﬁned for posterior computation.

We consider hospitalization data for {HF} in the most populated Italian Region, Lombardia. Data were extracted from the administrative data warehouse of the regional healthcare system. The main clinical outcome of interest is time to death and research focus is on investigating how recurrent hospitalizations affect the time to event. The main contribution of the article is to develop a joint model for gap times between consecutive rehospitalizations and survival time. The probability models for the gap times and for the survival outcome share a common patient speciﬁc frailty term. Using a ﬂexible Dirichlet process model for the random-effects distribution accounts for patient heterogeneity in recurrent event trajectories. Moreover, the joint model allows for dependent censoring of gap times by death or administrative reasons and for the correlations between different gap times for the same individual. It is straightforward to include covariates in the survival and/or recurrence process through the speciﬁcation of appropriate regression terms. The main advantages of the proposed methodology are wide applicability, ease of interpretation, and efﬁcient computations.

	doi = {10.1177/1740774509339238},
	abstract = {Background—It can be difficult to conduct pediatric clinical trials because there is often a low incidence of the disease in children, making accrual slow or infeasible. In addition, low mortality and morbidity in this population make it impractical to achieve adequate power. In this case, the only evidence for treatment efficacy comes from adult trials. Since pediatric care providers are accustomed to relying on evidence from adult studies, it is natural to consider borrowing information from adult trials.
Purpose—The goal of this article is to propose a Bayesian approach to the design and analysis of pediatric trials to allow borrowing strength from previous or simultaneous adult trials.
Methods—We apply a hierarchical model for which the efficacy parameter from the adult trial and that of the pediatric trail are considered to be draws from a normal distribution. The choice of (the variance of) this distribution is guided by discussion with medical experts. We show that with this information, one can calculate the sample size required for the pediatric trial. We discuss how inference of these studies in pediatric populations depends on the parameter that captures the similarity of the treatment efficacy in adults compared to children.
Results—The Bayesian approach can substantially increase the power of a pediatric clinical trial (or equivalently decrease the number of subjects required) by formally leveraging the data from the adult trial. Limitations—Our method relies on obtaining a value for the inter-study variability,, which may be difficult to describe to a clinical investigator.
Conclusions—The Bayesian approach has the potential of making pediatric clinical trials feasible because it has the effect of borrowing strength from adult trials, thus requiring a smaller pediatric trial to show efficacy of a drug in children.},

The transformation results in a domain which is [0, 1]. We model the cumulative distribution function as a mixture of Beta cumulative distribution functions, noting that the latter family is dense within the collection of all continuous densities on [0, 1]. For the fitting of the model we take a Bayesian approach, encouraging vague priors, to focus upon the likelihood. We discuss choices of such priors as well as the integrability of the resultant posteriors.

This procedure relies on a simple transformation of the cut-points that leaves the transformed cut-points unordered. For comparing these models, we develop a coherent approach based on marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors. To help in the assignment of prior distributions to regression parameters and the cut-points, di erent methods for forming and representing prior beliefs are provided. One set of methods is based on the idea of a training sample and a prior imaginary sample. Another method is based on the direct assessment of distributions on the multinomial response, followed by change of variable to a distribution on the parameters of the model.

In general {pD} approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher’s information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the ‘hat’ matrix projecting observations onto ﬁtted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of ﬁt or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the ﬁt and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding {pD} to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justiﬁcation.

	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation ({ABC}) refers to a family of inference methods used in the Bayesian analysis of complex models where evaluation of the likelihood is difﬁcult. Conventional {ABC} methods often suﬀer from the curse of dimensionality, and a marginal adjustment strategy was recently introduced in the literature to improve the performance of {ABC} algorithms in high-dimensional problems. The marginal adjustment approach is extended using a Gaussian copula approximation. The method ﬁrst estimates the bivariate posterior for each pair of parameters separately using a 2-dimensional Gaussian copula, and then combines these estimates together to estimate the joint posterior. The approximation works well in large sample settings when the posterior is approximately normal, but also works well in many cases which are far from that situation due to the nonparametric estimation of the marginal posterior distributions. If each bivariate posterior distribution can be well estimated with a lowdimensional {ABC} analysis then this Gaussian copula method can extend {ABC} methods to problems of high dimension. The method also results in an analytic expression for the approximate posterior which is useful for many purposes such as approximation of the likelihood itself. This method is illustrated with several examples.},

Finding this dose for drug-combination trials is complicated due to drug-drug interactions, and many trial designs have been proposed to address this issue. These designs rely on complicated statistical models that typically are not familiar to clinicians, and are rarely used in practice. The aim of this paper is to propose a Bayesian dose-ﬁnding design for drug combination trials based on standard logistic regression. Under the proposed design, we continuously update the posterior estimates of the model parameters to make the decisions of dose assignment and early stopping. Simulation studies show that the proposed design is competitive and outperforms some existing designs. We also extend our design to handle delayed toxicities.},

To search for the maximum tolerated dose combination, we continuously update the posterior estimates for the toxicity probabilities of the combined doses. By reordering the dose toxicities in the two-dimensional probability space, we adaptively assign each new cohort of patients to the most appropriate dose. Dose escalation, de-escalation or staying at the same doses is determined by comparing the posterior estimates of the probabilities of toxicity of combined doses and the prespeciﬁed toxicity target. We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the design and illustrate the proposed method under various practical scenarios.},

Extreme value considerations are used to derive two further new copulas: the t extreme value copula is the limiting copula of componentwise maxima of t distributed random vectors; the t lower tail copula is the limiting copula of bivariate observations from a t distribution that are conditioned to lie below some joint threshold that is progressively lowered.

	abstract = {Background: Traditionally, phase I oncology trials are designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose ({MTD}), defined as the highest dose with an acceptable probability of dose limiting toxicities({DLT}), of a new treatment via a dose escalation study. An alternate approach is to jointly model toxicity and efficacy and allow dose escalation to depend on a pre-specified efficacy/toxicity tradeoff in a phase I-{II} design. Several phase I-{II} trial designs have been discussed in the literature; while these model-based designs are attractive in their performance, they are potentially vulnerable to model misspecification.
Methods: Phase I-{II} designs often rely on copula models to specify the joint distribution of toxicity and efficacy, which include an additional correlation parameter that can be difficult to estimate. We compare and contrast three models for the joint probability of toxicity and efficacy, including two copula models that have been proposed for use in phase I-{II} clinical trials and a simple model that assumes the two outcomes are independent. We evaluate the performance of the various models through simulation both when the models are correct and under model misspecification.
Results: Both models exhibited similar performance, as measured by the probability of correctly identifying the optimal dose and the number of subjects treated at the optimal dose, regardless of whether the data were generated from the correct or incorrect copula, even when there is substantial correlation between the two outcomes. Similar results were observed for a simple model that assumes independence, even in the presence of strong correlation. Further simulation results indicate that estimating the correlation parameter in copula models is difficult with the sample sizes used in Phase I-{II} clinical trials.
Conclusions: Our simulation results indicate that the operating characteristics of phase I-{II} clinical trials are robust to misspecification of the copula model but that a simple model that assumes independence performs just as well due to difficulty in estimating the copula model correlation parameters from binary data.},

We first take a Bayesian copula-type model for dose finding in phase I. After identifying a set of admissible doses, we immediately move the entire set forward to phase {II}. We propose a novel adaptive randomization scheme to favor assigning patients to more efficacious dose-combination arms. Our adaptive randomization scheme takes into account both the point estimate and variability of efficacy. By using a moving reference to compare the relative efficacy among treatment arms, our method achieves a high resolution to distinguish different arms. We also consider groupwise adaptive randomization when efficacy is late-onset. We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the proposed design, and illustrate our method using a phase I/{II} melanoma clinical trial.},

	abstract = {A bivariate copula can be statistically interpreted as a bivariate distribution function with uniform marginals. Sklar (1959) argues that for any bivariate distribution function, say H with marginals F and G, there exists a copula functional, say C, such that H[x, y] = C[F[x], G[y]] , for (x, y)T in the support of H. What is to presented is a self-contained review, mainly from a statistical point of view, of the concept of copulas vis-a-vis multivariate distributions and dependence and to motivate their utility via a number of applications to the design of clinical trials, microarray studies with survival endpoints and the analysis of dependent Receiver Operator Curves ({ROC}).},

	abstract = {Randomized Controlled Trials ({RCTs}) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in {RCTs} over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment eﬀect ({ATE}), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more diﬃcult than commonly believed. At best, an {RCT} yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justiﬁcation is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding ‘external validity’ is unhelpful because it expects too much of an {RCT} while undervaluing its potential contribution. {RCTs} do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientiﬁc progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. {RCTs} can play a role in building scientiﬁc knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not ‘what works’, but ‘why things work’.},

	abstract = {Copula modelling has in the past decade become a standard tool in many areas of applied statistics. However, a largely neglected aspect concerns the design of related experiments. Particularly the issue of whether the estimation of copula parameters can be enhanced by optimizing experimental conditions and how robust all the parameter estimates for the model are with respect to the type of copula employed. In this paper an equivalence theorem for (bivariate) copula models is provided that allows formulation of eﬃcient design algorithms and quick checks of whether designs are optimal or at least eﬃcient. Some examples illustrate that in practical situations considerable gains in design eﬃciency can be achieved. A natural comparison between diﬀerent copula models with respect to design eﬃciency is provided as well.},

	abstract = {We consider a bivariate logistic model for a binary response, and we assume that two rival dependence structures are possible. Copula functions are very useful tools to model different kinds of dependence with arbitrary marginal distributions. We consider Clayton and Gumbel copulae as competing association models. The focus is on applications in testing a new drug looking at both efﬁcacy and toxicity outcomes. In this context, one of the main goals is to ﬁnd the dose which maximizes the probability of efﬁcacy without toxicity, herein called P-optimal dose. If the P-optimal dose changes under the two rival copulae, then it is relevant to identify the proper association model. To this aim, we propose a criterion (called {PKL}) which enables us to ﬁnd the optimal doses to discriminate between the rival copulae, subject to a constraint that protects patients against dangerous doses. Furthermore, by applying the likelihood ratio test for non-nested models, via a simulation study we conﬁrm that the {PKL}-optimal design is really able to discriminate between the rival copulae.},

They describe and interpret the results of a large Monte Carlo experiment designed to assess the effect of the sample size and the strength of dependence on the level and power of the blanket tests for various combinations of copula models under the null hypothesis and the alternative. To circumvent problems in the determination of the limiting distribution of the test statistics under composite null hypotheses, they recommend the use of a double parametric bootstrap procedure, whose implementation is detailed.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}. Standard physical, neurologic, and neuropsychologic examinations may not detect abnormalities after mild traumatic brain injury ({mTBI}). An analysis of eye movements may be more sensitive to neurologic dysfunction.
{METHODS}. We performed eye tracking assessments in 71 active duty and veteran military personnel with persistent postconcussive symptoms (3 months to 5 years after {mTBI}) and 75 volunteers with no history of brain injury. Both eyes were sampled at 500 Hz and analyzed for various eye measurement parameters during visual tasks involving the saccadic and smooth systems.
{RESULTS}. No difference between {mTBI} and normal participants in main sequence proﬁles was observed. On the circular task, intersaccadic interval duration was shorter in {mTBI} compared with normal subjects (horizontal: Cohen’s D ¼ À0.65; vertical: Cohen’s D ¼ À0.75). For reading, absolute saccadic amplitudes (Cohen’s D ¼ À0.76) and average forward saccadic amplitudes were lower (Cohen’s D ¼ À0.61). Absolute ﬁxation velocity was higher (Cohen’s D ¼ 1.02), and overall ﬁxation durations (Cohen’s D ¼ 0.58), regression durations (Cohen’s D ¼ 0.49), and forward saccadic durations (Cohen’s D¼0.54) were longer. {mTBI} participants had more ﬁxations (Cohen’s D ¼ 0.54) and regressions per line (Cohen’s D ¼ 0.70) and read fewer lines (Cohen’s D ¼ À0.38) than normal subjects. On the horizontal ramp task, {mTBI} participants had lower weighted smooth pursuit gains (Cohen’s D ¼ À0.55). On the horizontal step task, {mTBI} participants had shorter mean ﬁxation times (Cohen’s D ¼ À0.55).
{CONCLUSIONS}. These results suggest vulnerability of the smooth pursuit and saccadic systems in {mTBI}. Eye tracking shows promise as an objective, sensitive assessment of damage after {mTBI}. ({ClinicalTrials}.gov number, {NCT}01611194, {NCT}01925963.)},

	abstract = {Background The need for formal and structured approaches for beneﬁt–risk assessment of medicines is increasing, as is the complexity of the scientiﬁc questions addressed before making decisions on the beneﬁt–risk balance of medicines. We systematically collected, appraised and classiﬁed available beneﬁt–risk methodologies to facilitate and inform their future use.
Methods A systematic review of publications identiﬁed beneﬁt–risk assessment methodologies. Methodologies were appraised on their fundamental principles, features, graphical representations, assessability and accessibility. We created a taxonomy of methodologies to facilitate understanding and choice.
Results We identiﬁed 49 methodologies, critically appraised and classiﬁed them into four categories: frameworks, metrics, estimation techniques and utility survey techniques. Eight frameworks describe qualitative steps in beneﬁt–risk assessment and eight quantify beneﬁt–risk balance. Nine metric indices include threshold indices to measure either beneﬁt or risk; health indices measure quality-of-life over time; and trade-off indices integrate beneﬁts and risks. Six estimation techniques support beneﬁt–risk modelling and evidence synthesis. Four utility survey techniques elicit robust value preferences from relevant stakeholders to the beneﬁt–risk decisions.
Conclusions Methodologies to help beneﬁt–risk assessments of medicines are diverse and each is associated with different limitations and strengths. There is not a ‘one-size-ﬁts-all’ method, and a combination of methods may be needed for each beneﬁt–risk assessment. The taxonomy introduced herein may guide choice of adequate methodologies. Finally, we recommend 13 of 49 methodologies for further appraisal for use in the real-life beneﬁt–risk assessment of medicines. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The copula parameters are treated as nuisance variables, and hence do not have to be estimated. Furthermore, by a parameterization of the copula density in terms of Kendall’s , the prior on the parameter is replaced by a prior on , conceptually more meaningful. The prior on , common to all families in the set of tested copulas, serves as a basis for their comparison. Using simulated data sets, we study the reliability of the method and observe the following: (1) the frequency of successful identiﬁcation approaches 100\% as the sample size increases, (2) for weakly correlated variables, larger samples are necessary for reliable identiﬁcation.},

Our method is the ﬁrst to jointly estimate the posterior distribution of all trees of a regular vine copula. This represents a substantial improvement over existing frequentist and Bayesian strategies, which can only select one tree at a time and are known to induce bias. A simulation study demonstrates the feasibility of our strategy and shows that it combines superior selection and reduced computation time compared to Bayesian tree-by-tree selection. In a real data example, we forecast the daily expected tail loss of a portfolio of nine exchange-traded funds using a fully Bayesian multivariate dynamic model built around Bayesian regular vine copulas to illustrate our model’s viability for ﬁnancial analysis and risk estimation.},

We focus on the deviance information criterion. The joint estimation takes into account all dependence structure of the parameters’ posterior distributions in our chosen model selection criteria. Two Monte Carlo studies are conducted to show that model identiﬁcation improves when the model parameters are jointly estimated.

In the Bayesian framework, allocation probabilities to different treatment arms are commonly deﬁned as functionals of the posterior distributions of parameters of the outcome distribution for each treatment. In a non-conjugate model, however, repeated updates of the posterior distribution can be computationally intensive. In this article, we propose an adaptation of sequential Monte Carlo for efﬁciently updating the posterior distribution of parameters as new outcomes are observed in a general adaptive trial design. An efﬁcient computational tool facilitates implementation of more ﬂexible designs with more frequent interim looks that can in turn reduce the required sample size and expected number of failures in clinical trials. Moreover, more complex statistical models that reﬂect realistic modeling assumptions can be used for analysis of trial results.},

A third design that assumes homogeneity and ignores possible treatment-subgroup interactions also is considered. The three approaches are applied to construct group sequential designs for a trial of nutritional prehabilitation versus standard of care for esophageal cancer patients undergoing chemoradiation and surgery, including both untreated patients and salvage patients whose disease has recurred following previous therapy. A simulation study is presented that compares the three designs, including evaluation of within-subgroup type I and {II} error probabilities under a variety of scenarios including diﬀerent combinations of treatment-subgroup interactions.},

	abstract = {We develop efficient Bayesian inference for the one-factor copula model with two significant contributions over existing methodologies. First, our approach leads to straightforward inference on dependence parameters and the latent factor; only inference on the former is available under frequentist alternatives. Second, we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that averages over models constructed from different bivariate copula building blocks. Our approach accommodates any combination of discrete and continuous margins. Through extensive simulations, we compare the computational and Monte Carlo efficiency of alternative proposed sampling schemes. The preferred algorithm provides reliable inference on parameters, the latent factor, and model space. The potential of the methodology is highlighted in an empirical study of 10 binary measures of socio-economic deprivation collected for 11,463 East Timorese households. The importance of conducting inference on the latent factor is motivated by constructing a poverty index using estimates of the factor. Compared to a linear Gaussian factor model, our model average improves out-of-sample fit. The relationships between the poverty index and observed variables uncovered by our approach are diverse and allow for a richer and more precise understanding of the dependence between overall deprivation and individual measures of well-being.},

	abstract = {A data coordinating team performed onsite audits and discovered discrepancies between the data sent to the coordinating center and that recorded at sites. We present statistical methods for incorporating audit results into analyses. This can be thought of as a measurement error problem, where the distribution of errors is a mixture with a point mass at 0. If the error rate is nonzero, then even if the mean of the discrepancy between the reported and correct values of a predictor is 0, naive estimates of the association between two continuous variables will be biased. We consider scenarios where there are (1) errors in the predictor, (2) errors in the outcome, and (3) possibly correlated errors in the predictor and outcome. We show how to incorporate the error rate and magnitude, estimated from a random subset (the audited records), to compute unbiased estimates of association and proper conﬁdence intervals. We then extend these results to multiple linear regression where multiple covariates may be incorrect in the database and the rate and magnitude of the errors may depend on study site. We study the ﬁnite sample properties of our estimators using simulations, discuss some practical considerations, and illustrate our methods with data from 2815 {HIV}-infected patients in Latin America, of whom 234 had their data audited using a sequential auditing plan.},

	abstract = {The main goal of this thesis is to develop Bayesian model for studying the inﬂuence of covariate on dependence between random variables. Conditional copula models are ﬂexible tools for modelling complex dependence structures. We construct Bayesian inference for the conditional copula model adapted to regression settings in which the bivariate outcome is continuous or mixed (binary and continuous) and the copula parameter varies with covariate values. The functional relationship between the copula parameter and the covariate is modelled using cubic splines. We also extend our work to additive models which would allow us to handle more than one covariate while keeping the computational burden within reasonable limits. We perform the proposed joint Bayesian inference via adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The deviance information criterion and cross-validated marginal log-likelihood criterion are employed for three model selection problems: 1) choosing the copula family that best ﬁts the data, 2) selecting the calibration function, i.e., checking if parametric form for copula parameter is suitable and 3) determining the number of independent variables in the additive model. The performance of the estimation and model selection techniques are investigated via simulations and demonstrated on two data sets: 1) Matched Multiple Birth and 2) Burn Injury. In which of interest is the inﬂuence of gestational age and maternal age on twin birth weights in the former data, whereas in the later data we are interested in investigating how patient’s age aﬀects the severity of burn injury and the probability of death.},

Moreover, a correct model of a constant relationship results in signiﬁcant gains of statistical eﬃciency. We develop methodology for testing a parametric formulation of the calibration function against a general alternative and propose a generalized likelihood ratio-type test that enables conditional copula model diagnostics.
