	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0922},
	abstract = {Many have suggested a bootstrap procedure for estimating the sampling variability of principal component analysis ({PCA}) results. However, when the number of measurements per subject (\$p\$) is much larger than the number of subjects (\$n\$), the challenge of calculating and storing the leading principal components from each bootstrap sample can be computationally infeasible. To address this, we outline methods for fast, exact calculation of bootstrap principal components, eigenvalues, and scores. Our methods leverage the fact that all bootstrap samples occupy the same \$n\$-dimensional subspace as the original sample. As a result, all bootstrap principal components are limited to the same \$n\$-dimensional subspace and can be efficiently represented by their low dimensional coordinates in that subspace. Several uncertainty metrics can be computed solely based on the bootstrap distribution of these low dimensional coordinates, without calculating or storing the \$p\$-dimensional bootstrap components. Fast bootstrap {PCA} is applied to a dataset of sleep electroencephalogram ({EEG}) recordings (\$p=900\$, \$n=392\$), and to a dataset of brain magnetic resonance images ({MRIs}) (\$p{\textbackslash}approx\$ 3 million, \$n=352\$). For the brain {MRI} dataset, our method allows for standard errors for the first 3 principal components based on 1000 bootstrap samples to be calculated on a standard laptop in 47 minutes, as opposed to approximately 4 days with standard methods.},

	abstract = {The extraction of information from multiple sets of data is a problem inherent to many disciplines. This is possible by either analyzing the data sets jointly as in data fusion or separately and then combining as in data integration. However, selecting the optimal method to combine and analyze multiset data is an ever-present challenge. The primary reason for this is the difficulty in determining the optimal contribution of each data set to an analysis as well as the amount of potentially exploitable complementary information among data sets. In this paper, we propose a novel classification rate-based technique to unambiguously quantify the contribution of each data set to a fusion result as well as facilitate direct comparisons of fusion methods on real data and apply a new method, independent vector analysis ({IVA}), to multiset fusion. This classification rate-based technique is used on functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from 121 patients with schizophrenia and 150 healthy controls during the performance of three tasks. Through this application, we find that though optimal performance is achieved by exploiting all tasks, each task does not contribute equally to the result and this framework enables effective quantification of the value added by each task. Our results also demonstrate that data fusion methods are more powerful than data integration methods, with the former achieving a classification rate of 73.5 \% and the latter achieving one of 70.9 \%, a difference which we show is significant when all three tasks are analyzed together. Finally, we show that {IVA}, due to its flexibility, has equivalent or superior performance compared with the popular data fusion method, joint independent component analysis.},

	abstract = {"Mixed Data" comprising a large number of heterogeneous variables (e.g. count, binary, continuous, skewed continuous, among other data types) are prevalent in varied areas such as genomics and proteomics, imaging genetics, national security, social networking, and Internet advertising. There have been limited efforts at statistically modeling such mixed data jointly, in part because of the lack of computationally amenable multivariate distributions that can capture direct dependencies between such mixed variables of different types. In this paper, we address this by introducing a novel class of Block Directed Markov Random Fields ({BDMRFs}). Using the basic building block of node-conditional univariate exponential families from Yang et al. (2012), we introduce a class of mixed conditional random field distributions, that are then chained according to a block-directed acyclic graph to form our class of Block Directed Markov Random Fields ({BDMRFs}). The Markov independence graph structure underlying a {BDMRF} thus has both directed and undirected edges. We introduce conditions under which these distributions exist and are normalizable, study several instances of our models, and propose scalable penalized conditional likelihood estimators with statistical guarantees for recovering the underlying network structure. Simulations as well as an application to learning mixed genomic networks from next generation sequencing expression data and mutation data demonstrate the versatility of our methods.},

	abstract = {Due to the dynamic, condition-dependent nature of brain activity, interest in estimating rapid functional connectivity ({FC}) changes that occur during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-{fMRI}) has recently soared. However, studying dynamic {FC} is methodologically challenging, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the blood oxygen level dependent ({BOLD}) signal in {fMRI} and the massive number of data points generated during the analysis. Thus, it is important to establish methods and summary measures that maximize reliability and the utility of dynamic {FC} to provide insight into brain function. In this study, we investigated the reliability of dynamic {FC} summary measures derived using three commonly used estimation methods - sliding window ({SW}), tapered sliding window ({TSW}), and dynamic conditional correlations ({DCC}) methods. We applied each of these techniques to two publicly available rs-{fMRI} test-retest data sets - the Multi-Modal {MRI} Reproducibility Resource (Kirby Data) and the Human Connectome Project ({HCP} Data). The reliability of two categories of dynamic {FC} summary measures were assessed, specifically basic summary statistics of the dynamic correlations and summary measures derived from recurring whole-brain patterns of {FC} (“brain states”). The results provide evidence that dynamic correlations are reliably detected in both test-retest data sets, and the {DCC} method outperforms {SW} methods in terms of the reliability of summary statistics. However, across all estimation methods, reliability of the brain state-derived measures was low. Notably, the results also show that the {DCC}-derived dynamic correlation variances are significantly more reliable than those derived using the non-parametric estimation methods. This is important, as the fluctuations of dynamic {FC} (i.e., its variance) has a strong potential to provide summary measures that can be used to find meaningful individual differences in dynamic {FC}. We therefore conclude that utilizing the variance of the dynamic connectivity is an important component in any dynamic {FC}-derived summary measure.},

The appeal of the cleverness of the procedure seems to replace the need for a rigorous argument that it produces valid hypothesis tests. The consequence of this educational failing has been a widespread belief in a “permutation principle”, which is supposed invariably to give tests that are valid by construction, under an absolute minimum of statistical assumptions. Several lines of argument are presented here to show that the permutation principle itself can be invalid, concentrating on the Fisher-Pitman permutation test for two means. A simple counterfactual example illustrates the general problem, and a slightly more elaborate counterfactual argument is used to explain why the main mathematical proof of the validity of permutation tests is mistaken. Two modifications of the permutation test are suggested to be valid in a very modest simulation. In instances where simulation software is readily available, investigating the validity of a specific permutation test can be done easily, requiring only a minimum understanding of statistical technicalities.},

At the same time, and despite widely publicized controversy, P-values remain the most commonly used measure to statistically justify relationships identified between variables. Here we measure the ability to detect statistically significant relationships from scatterplots in a randomized trial of 2,039 students in a statistics massive open online course ({MOOC}). Each subject was shown a random set of scatterplots and asked to visually determine if the underlying relationships were statistically significant at the P {\textless} 0.05 level. Subjects correctly classified only 47.4\% (95\% {CI} [45.1\%–49.7\%]) of statistically significant relationships, and 74.6\% (95\% {CI} [72.5\%–76.6\%]) of non-significant relationships. Adding visual aids such as a best fit line or scatterplot smooth increased the probability a relationship was called significant, regardless of whether the relationship was actually significant. Classification of statistically significant relationships improved on repeat attempts of the survey, although classification of non-significant relationships did not. Our results suggest: (1) that evidence-based data analysis can be used to identify weaknesses in theoretical procedures in the hands of average users, (2) data analysts can be trained to improve detection of statistically significant results with practice, but (3) data analysts have incorrect intuition about what statistically significant relationships look like, particularly for small effects.

	abstract = {Information from historical trials is important for the design, interim monitoring, analysis, and interpretation of clinical trials. Meta-analytic models can be used to synthesize the evidence from historical data, which are often only available in aggregate form. We consider evidence synthesis methods for trials with recurrent event endpoints, which are common in many therapeutic areas. Such endpoints are typically analyzed by negative binomial regression. However, the individual patient data necessary to fit such a model are usually unavailable for historical trials reported in the medical literature. We describe approaches for back-calculating model parameter estimates and their standard errors from available summary statistics with various techniques, including approximate Bayesian computation. We propose to use a quadratic approximation to the log-likelihood for each historical trial based on 2 independent terms for the log mean rate and the log of the dispersion parameter. A Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis model then provides the posterior predictive distribution for these parameters. Simulations show this approach with back-calculated parameter estimates results in very similar inference as using parameter estimates from individual patient data as an input. We illustrate how to design and analyze a new randomized placebo-controlled exacerbation trial in severe eosinophilic asthma using data from 11 historical trials.},

	abstract = {A recent proposal to "redefine statistical significance" (Benjamin, et al. Nature Human Behaviour, 2017) claims that false positive rates "would immediately improve" by factors greater than two and replication rates would double simply by changing the conventional cutoff for 'statistical significance' from P{\textless}0.05 to P{\textless}0.005.  I analyze the veracity of these claims, focusing especially on how Benjamin, et al neglect the effects of P-hacking in assessing the impact of their proposal. My analysis shows that once P-hacking is accounted for the perceived benefits of the lower threshold all but disappear, prompting two main conclusions: (i) The claimed improvements to false positive rate and replication rate in Benjamin, et al (2017) are exaggerated and misleading. (ii) There are plausible scenarios under which the lower cutoff will make the replication crisis worse.},

However, it is often difficult to comprehend the available evidence because of the complex combination of interventions across trials, in addition to the limited search and retrieval tools available in databases such as {ClinicalTrials}.gov. Here we demonstrate the use of networks to visualize and quantitatively analyze the co-occurrence of drug interventions across trials on depression in {ClinicalTrials}.gov. The analysis identified general co-occurrence patterns of interventions across all depression trials, and specific co-occurrence patterns related to antidepressants and natural supplements. These results led to insights about the current state of depression trials, and to a graph-theoretic measure to categorize interventions for a disease. We conclude by discussing the opportunities and challenges of generalizing our approach to analyze comparative interventional studies for any disease.},

When covariate information on patients is available, logistic regression and other multivariate techniques are often used to select prognostic factors and create predictive models. An example shows how the explicit aim of prediction needs to be taken into account in such modelling, and how predictive performance may be assessed by decomposition of a scoring rule. Secondly, results from a program that provides pretrial and interim predictions in clinical trials are displayed, bringing together the use of subjective opinion, Bayesian methodology and techniques for evaluating and criticizing predictions.},

	abstract = {We study the application of a widely used ordinal regression model, the cumulative probability model ({CPM}), for continuous outcomes. Such models are attractive for the analysis of continuous response variables because they are invariant to any monotonic transformation of the outcome and because they directly model the cumulative distribution function from which summaries such as expectations and quantiles can easily be derived. Such models can also readily handle mixed type distributions. We describe the motivation, estimation, inference, model assumptions, and diagnostics. We demonstrate that {CPMs} applied to continuous outcomes are semiparametric transformation models. Extensive simulations are performed to investigate the finite sample performance of these models. We find that properly specified {CPMs} generally have good finite sample performance with moderate sample sizes, but that bias may occur when the sample size is small. Cumulative probability models are fairly robust to minor or moderate link function misspecification in our simulations. For certain purposes, the {CPMs} are more efficient than other models. We illustrate their application, with model diagnostics, in a study of the treatment of {HIV}. {CD}4 cell count and viral load 6 months after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy are modeled using {CPMs}; both variables typically require transformations, and viral load has a large proportion of measurements below a detection limit.},

	abstract = {A number of functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studies reported the existence of default mode network ({DMN}) and its disruption due to the presence of a disease such as Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). In this investigation, first, we used the independent component analysis ({ICA}) technique to confirm the {DMN} difference between patients with {AD} and normal control ({NC}) reported in previous studies. Consistent with the previous studies, the decreased resting-state functional connectivity of {DMN} in {AD} was identified in posterior cingulated cortex ({PCC}), medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}), inferior parietal cortex ({IPC}), inferior temporal cortex ({ITC}), and hippocampus ({HC}). Moreover, we introduced Bayesian network ({BN}) to study the effective connectivity of {DMN} and the difference between {AD} and {NC}. When compared the {DMN} effective connectivity in {AD} with the one in {NC} using a nonparametric random permutation test, we found that connections from left {HC} to left {IPC}, left {ITC} to right {HC}, right {HC} to left {IPC}, to {MPFC} and to {PCC} were all lost. In addition, in {AD} group, the connection directions between right {HC} and left {HC}, between left {HC} and left {ITC}, and between right {IPC} and right {ITC} were opposite to those in {NC} group. The connections of right {HC} to other regions, except left {HC}, within the {BN} were all statistically in-distinguishable from 0, suggesting an increased right hippocampal pathological and functional burden in {AD}. The altered effective connectivity in patients with {AD} may reveal more characteristics of the disease and may serve as a potential biomarker. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Using the mathematical framework of complex networks, these interaction patterns can be parsimoniously represented as brain graphs: each brain area is represented as a network node and each connection is represented as a network edge. These methods have been used to demonstrate that human brain networks display properties such as a small-world architecture that may directly facilitate cognitive processes. Moreover, mounting evidence suggests that these properties are altered in disease states, potentially providing important biomarkers for psychiatric and neurological disorders and informing our understanding of the mechanisms of altered cognitive function. Here, the basic concepts in network science are reviewed, and the properties of healthy and diseased brain networks discussed. Relationships between network diagnostics and alterations in behavioural or cognitive variables associated with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and epilepsy are highlighted.

Therefore, there is a strong need for accurate and sensitive tools for the early diagnoses of {AD}. The complex etiology and multiple pathogenesis of {AD} call for a system-level understanding of the currently available biomarkers and the study of new biomarkers via network-based modeling of heterogeneous data types. In this review, we summarize recent research on the study of {AD} as a connectivity syndrome. We argue that a network-based approach in biomarker discovery will provide key insights to fully understand the network degeneration hypothesis (disease starts in specific network areas and progressively spreads to connected areas of the initial loci-networks) with a potential impact for early diagnosis and disease-modifying treatments. We introduce a new framework for the quantitative study of biomarkers that can help shorten the transition between academic research and clinical diagnosis in {AD}.},

	abstract = {Background
Most pediatric kidney transplant recipients eventually require retransplantation, and the most advantageous timing strategy regarding deceased and living donor transplantation in candidates with only one living donor remains unclear.

Methods
A patient-oriented Markov decision process model was designed to compare, for a given patient with one living donor, living-donor-first followed if necessary by deceased donor retransplantation versus deceased-donor-first followed if necessary by living donor (if still able to donate) or deceased donor (if not) retransplantation. Based on Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data, the model was designed to account for waitlist, graft, and patient survival, sensitization, increased risk of graft failure seen during late adolescence, and differential deceased donor waiting times based upon pediatric-priority allocation policies. Based on national cohort data, the model was also designed to account for aging or disease development leading to ineligibility of the living donor over time.

Results
Given a set of candidate and living donor characteristics, the Markov model provides the expected patient survival over a time horizon of 20 years. For the most highly sensitized patients ({PRA}{\textgreater}80\%), a deceased-donor-first strategy was advantageous, but for all other patients ({PRA}{\textless}80\%), a living-donor-first strategy was recommended.

Conclusions
This Markov model illustrates how patients, families, and providers can be provided information and predictions regarding the most advantageous use of deceased donor versus living donor transplantation for pediatric recipients.},

We propose an additional ischemia time, extraction time, beginning with aortic cross-clamp and perfusion/cooling of the kidneys, and ending with removal of the kidneys and placement on ice on the backtable. During this time the kidneys rewarm, suffering an additional ischemic insult, which may impair transplant function. We measured extraction times of 576 kidneys recovered and transplanted locally between January 2006 and December 2008, then linked to Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients ({SRTR}) data for outcomes. Extraction time ranged from 14 to 123 min, with a mean of 44.7 min. In {SRTR}-adjusted analyses, longer extraction time and {DGF} were statistically associated (odds ratio [{OR}] = 1.19 per 5 min beyond 60 min, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.02–1.39, p = 0.03). Up to 60 min of extraction time, {DGF} incidence was 27.8\%; by 120 min it doubled to nearly 60\%. Although not statistically significant ({OR} = 1.19, 95\% {CI} 0.96–1.49, p = 0.11), primary nonfunction rate also rose dramatically to nearly 20\% by 120 min extraction time.

	abstract = {The use of the proportional odds ({PO}) model for ordinal regression is ubiquitous in the literature. If the assumption of parallel lines does not hold for the data, then an alternative is to specify a non-proportional odds ({NPO}) model, where the regression parameters are allowed to vary depending on the level of the response. However, it is often difficult to fit these models, and challenges regarding model choice and fitting are further compounded if there are a large number of explanatory variables. We make two contributions towards tackling these issues: firstly, we develop a Bayesian method for fitting these models, that ensures the stochastic ordering conditions hold for an arbitrary finite range of the explanatory variables, allowing {NPO} models to be fitted to any observed data set. Secondly, we use reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to allow the model to choose between {PO} and {NPO} structures for each explanatory variable, and show how variable selection can be incorporated. These methods can be adapted for any monotonic increasing link functions. We illustrate the utility of these approaches on novel data from a longitudinal study of individual-level risk factors affecting body condition score in a dog population in Zenzele, South Africa.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of Bayesian sample size determination for a clinical trial in the presence of historical data that inform the treatment effect. Our broadly applicable, simulation-based methodology provides a framework for calibrating the informativeness of a prior while simultaneously identifying the minimum sample size required for a new trial such that the overall design has appropriate power to detect a non-null treatment effect and reasonable type I error control. We develop a comprehensive strategy for eliciting null and alternative sampling prior distributions which are used to deﬁne Bayesian generalizations of the traditional notions of type I error control and power. Bayesian type I error control requires that a weighted-average type I error rate not exceed a prespeciﬁed threshold. We develop a procedure for generating an appropriately sized Bayesian hypothesis test using a simple partial-borrowing power prior which summarizes the fraction of information borrowed from the historical trial. We present results from simulation studies that demonstrate that a hypothesis test procedure based on this simple power prior is as efﬁcient as those based on more complicated meta-analytic priors, such as normalized power priors or robust mixture priors, when all are held to precise type I error control requirements. We demonstrate our methodology using a real data set to design a follow-up clinical trial with time-to-event endpoint for an investigational treatment in high-risk melanoma.},

In this article, we describe an extended framework, encompassing multiple outcomes of any type, each of which could be repeatedly measured (longitudinal), with any number of levels, and with any number of random eﬀects at each level. Many standard distributions are described, as well as nonstandard user-deﬁned non-linear models. The extension focuses on a complex linear predictor for each outcome model, allowing sharing and linking between outcome models in an extremely ﬂexible way, either by linking random eﬀects directly, or the expected value of one outcome (or function of it) within the linear predictor of another. Non-linear and time-dependent eﬀects are also seamlessly incorporated to the linear predictor through the use of splines or fractional polynomials. We further propose level-speciﬁc random eﬀect distributions and numerical integration techniques to improve usability, relaxing the normally distributed random eﬀects assumption to allow multivariate tdistributed random eﬀects. We consider some special cases of the general framework, describing some new models in the ﬁelds of clustered survival data, joint longitudinal-survival models, and discuss various potential uses of the implementation.

Bayesian analyses use available patient-outcome information, including biomarkers that accumulating data indicate might be related to clinical outcome. They also allow for the use of historical information and for synthesizing results of relevant trials.

	abstract = {Background The Bayesian approach is being used increasingly in medical research. In particular, it has become a standard in designing clinical trials at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.
Purpose/Methods To address the extent and nature of Bayesian trials conducted at M. D. Anderson, we reviewed the protocols registered in the Protocol Document Online System between 2000 and early 2005. We summarize our findings and give details for three innovative trials that typify those in which a Bayesian approach has played a major role at the center.
Results Of 964 protocols reviewed, 59\% were conducted solely at M. D. Anderson and the rest were multicenter trials. Bayesian designs and analyses were used in about 20\% (195/964) of the protocols that we reviewed. Of the 520 protocols identified as phase I or {II} drug trials, about 34\% were Bayesian. Most of the 195 Bayesian trials were designed by M. D. Anderson statisticians. The Bayesian design features most commonly used were the continuous reassessment method in phase I (toxicity) trials, adaptive randomization in phase {II} trials, and designs to monitor efficacy and toxicity simultaneously. We also provide an insider’s view regarding some practical considerations that have made the design and implementation of so many Bayesian trials possible. Limitations We reviewed only a subset of all M. D. Anderson protocols, but did not exclude any available in electronic form.
Conclusions The large number of Bayesian trials conducted at M. D. Anderson testifies to the receptivity to the Bayesian approach within the center, including principal investigators, regulatory review committees, and patients. Statisticians who take a Bayesian perspective can successfully work to establish a culture of innovation in clinical trial design. Clinical Trials 2009; 6: 205–216. http://ctj.sagepub.com},

Frequentist inference, and its null hypothesis significance testing ({NHST}), has been hegemonic through most of the history of scientific psychology. However, the {NHST} has not been exempt of criticisms. Therefore, the aim of this chapter is to introduce a Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing that may represent a useful complement, or even an alternative, to the current {NHST}. The advantages of this Bayesian approach over Frequentist {NHST} will be presented, providing examples that support its use in psychology and social sciences. Conclusions are outlined.},

The Bayesian framework provides a uniﬁed approach for incorporating prior information and/or uncertainties regarding the statistical model with a utility function which describes the experimental aims. In this paper, we provide a general overview on the concepts involved in Bayesian experimental design, and focus on describing some of the more commonly used Bayesian utility functions and methods for their estimation, as well as a number of algorithms that are used to search over the design space to ﬁnd the Bayesian optimal design.

The Alliance trial data was used owing to the quality and breadth of data, and because of the expertise in these trials of one of us (D.J.S.). {DATA} {EXTRACTION} {AND} {SYNTHESIS} The {NCI} {SEER} and Alliance data have already been thoroughly vetted. Computations were replicated independently by 2 coauthors and reviewed by all coauthors. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES} Our prior hypothesis was that an alpha of 2.5\% would not minimize the overall expected harm to current and future patients for the most deadly cancers, and that a less conservative alpha may be necessary. Our primary study outcomes involve measuring the potential harm to patients under both null and alternative hypotheses using {NCI} and Alliance data, and then computing {BDA}-optimal type 1 error rates and sample sizes for oncology {RCTs}.
{RESULTS} We computed {BDA}-optimal parameters for the 23 most common cancer sites using {NCI} data, and for the 10 Alliance clinical trials. For {RCTs} involving therapies for cancers with short survival times, no existing treatments, and low prevalence, the {BDA}-optimal type 1 error rates were much higher than the traditional 2.5\%. For cancers with longer survival times, existing treatments, and high prevalence, the corresponding {BDA}-optimal error rates were much lower, in some cases even lower than 2.5\%.
{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE} Bayesian decision analysis is a systematic, objective, transparent, and repeatable process for deciding the outcomes of {RCTs} that explicitly incorporates burden of disease and patient preferences.},

For relatively less deadly conditions such as prostate cancer, 2.5\% is more risk-tolerant or aggressive than the {BDA}-optimal threshold of 1.2\% to 1.5\%.

We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric modeling approach for univariate and multivariate ordinal regression, which is based on mixture modeling for the joint distribution of latent responses and covariates. The modeling framework enables highly flexible inference for ordinal regression relationships, avoiding assumptions of linearity or additivity in the covariate effects. In standard parametric ordinal regression models, computational challenges arise from identifiability constraints and estimation of parameters requiring nonstandard inferential techniques. A key feature of the nonparametric model is that it achieves inferential flexibility, while avoiding these difficulties. In particular, we establish full support of the nonparametric mixture model under fixed cut-off points that relate through discretization the latent continuous responses with the ordinal responses. The practical utility of the modeling approach is illustrated through application to two data sets from econometrics, an example involving regression relationships for ozone concentration, and a multirater agreement problem.},

In this paper, we propose empirical and fully Bayesian modifications of the commensurate prior model (Hobbs et al., 2011) extending Pocock (1976), and evaluate their frequentist and Bayesian properties for incorporating patient-level historical data using general and generalized linear mixed regression models. Our proposed commensurate prior models lead to preposterior admissible estimators that facilitate alternative bias-variance trade-offs than those offered by preexisting methodologies for incorporating historical data from a small number of historical studies.

However when prior and current information conflict, Bayesian methods can lead to higher than expected Type I error, as well as the possibility of a costlier and lengthier trial. This motivates an investigation of the feasibility of hierarchical Bayesian methods for incorporating historical data that are adaptively robust to prior information that reveals itself to be inconsistent with the accumulating experimental data. In this paper, we present several models that allow for the commensurability of the information in the historical and current data to determine how much historical information is used. A primary tool is elaborating the traditional power prior approach based upon a measure of commensurability for Gaussian data. We compare the frequentist performance of several methods using simulations, and close with an example of a colon cancer trial that illustrates a linear models extension of our adaptive borrowing approach. Our proposed methods produce more precise estimates of the model parameters, in particular conferring statistical significance to the observed reduction in tumor size for the experimental regimen as compared to the control regimen.},

	abstract = {Clinical trials rarely, if ever, occur in a vacuum. Generally, large amounts of clinical data are available prior to the start of a study, particularly on the current study’s control arm. There is obvious appeal in using (i.e., ‘borrowing’) this information. With historical data providing information on the control arm, more trial resources can be devoted to the novel treatment while retaining accurate estimates of the current control arm parameters. This can result in more accurate point estimates, increased power, and reduced type I error in clinical trials, provided the historical information is sufficiently similar to the current control data. If this assumption of similarity is not satisfied, however, one can acquire increased mean square error of point estimates due to bias and either reduced power or increased type I error depending on the direction of the bias. In this manuscript, we review several methods for historical borrowing, illustrating how key parameters in each method affect borrowing behavior, and then, we compare these methods on the basis of mean square error, power and type I error. We emphasize two main themes. First, we discuss the idea of ‘dynamic’ (versus ‘static’) borrowing. Second, we emphasize the decision process involved in determining whether or not to include historical borrowing in terms of the perceived likelihood that the current control arm is sufficiently similar to the historical data. Our goal is to provide a clear review of the key issues involved in historical borrowing and provide a comparison of several methods useful for practitioners.},

Using α-spending functions to control the overall type I error rate, group sequential methods are well established and have been dominating phase {III} studies. Bayesian randomized design, on the other hand, can be viewed as a complement instead of competitive approach to the frequentist methods. For the ﬁxed Bayesian design, the hypothesis testing can be cast in the posterior probability or Bayes factor framework, which has a direct link to the frequentist type I error rate. Bayesian group sequential design relies upon Bayesian decision-theoretic approaches based on backward induction, which is often computationally intensive. Compared with the frequentist approaches, Bayesian methods have several advantages. The posterior predictive probability serves as a useful and convenient tool for trial monitoring, and can be updated at any time as the data accrue during the trial. The Bayesian decisiontheoretic framework possesses a direct link to the decision making in the practical setting, and can be modeled more realistically to reﬂect the actual cost–beneﬁt analysis during the drug development process. Other merits include the possibility of hierarchical modeling and the use of informative priors, which would lead to a more comprehensive utilization of information from both historical and longitudinal data. From ﬁxed to adaptive design, we focus on Bayesian randomized controlled clinical trials and make extensive comparisons with frequentist counterparts through numerical studies.},

	abstract = {Although the frequentist paradigm has been the predominant approach to clinical trial design since the 1940s, it has several notable limitations. The alternative Bayesian paradigm has been greatly enhanced by advancements in computational algorithms and computer hardware. Compared to its frequentist counterpart, the Bayesian framework has several unique advantages, and its incorporation into clinical trial design is occurring more frequently. Using an extensive literature review to assess how Bayesian methods are used in clinical trials, we find them most commonly used for dose finding, efficacy monitoring, toxicity monitoring, diagnosis/decision making, and for studying pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. The additional infrastructure required for implementing Bayesian methods in clinical trials may include specialized software programs to run the study design, simulation, and analysis, and Web-based applications, which are particularly useful for timely data entry and analysis. Trial success requires not only the development of proper tools but also timely and accurate execution of data entry, quality control, adaptive randomization, and Bayesian computation. The relative merit of the Bayesian and frequentist approaches continues to be the subject of debate in statistics. However, more evidence can be found showing the convergence of the two camps, at least at the practical level. Ultimately, better clinical trial methods lead to more efficient designs, lower sample sizes, more accurate conclusions, and better outcomes for patients enrolled in the trials. Bayesian methods offer attractive alternatives for better trials. More such trials should be designed and conducted to refine the approach and demonstrate its real benefit in action.},

	abstract = {Background: Bayesian statistics are an appealing alternative to the traditional frequentist approach to designing, analysing, and reporting of clinical trials, especially in rare diseases. Time-to-event endpoints are widely used in many medical fields. There are additional complexities to designing Bayesian survival trials which arise from the need to specify a model for the survival distribution. The objective of this article was to critically review the use and reporting of Bayesian methods in survival trials.
Methods: A systematic review of clinical trials using Bayesian survival analyses was performed through {PubMed} and Web of Science databases. This was complemented by a full text search of the online repositories of pre-selected journals. Cost-effectiveness, dose-finding studies, meta-analyses, and methodological papers using clinical trials were excluded.
Results: In total, 28 articles met the inclusion criteria, 25 were original reports of clinical trials and 3 were re-analyses of a clinical trial. Most trials were in oncology (n = 25), were randomised controlled (n = 21) phase {III} trials (n = 13), and half considered a rare disease (n = 13). Bayesian approaches were used for monitoring in 14 trials and for the final analysis only in 14 trials. In the latter case, Bayesian survival analyses were used for the primary analysis in four cases, for the secondary analysis in seven cases, and for the trial re-analysis in three cases. Overall, 12 articles reported fitting Bayesian regression models (semi-parametric, n = 3; parametric, n = 9). Prior distributions were often incompletely reported: 20 articles did not define the prior distribution used for the parameter of interest. Over half of the trials used only non-informative priors for monitoring and the final analysis (n = 12) when it was specified. Indeed, no articles fitting Bayesian regression models placed informative priors on the parameter of interest. The prior for the treatment effect was based on historical data in only four trials. Decision rules were pre-defined in eight cases when trials used Bayesian monitoring, and in only one case when trials adopted a Bayesian approach to the final analysis.
Conclusion: Few trials implemented a Bayesian survival analysis and few incorporated external data into priors. There is scope to improve the quality of reporting of Bayesian methods in survival trials. Extension of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement for reporting Bayesian clinical trials is recommended.},

We consider hospitalization data for {HF} in the most populated Italian Region, Lombardia. Data were extracted from the administrative data warehouse of the regional healthcare system. The main clinical outcome of interest is time to death and research focus is on investigating how recurrent hospitalizations affect the time to event. The main contribution of the article is to develop a joint model for gap times between consecutive rehospitalizations and survival time. The probability models for the gap times and for the survival outcome share a common patient speciﬁc frailty term. Using a ﬂexible Dirichlet process model for the random-effects distribution accounts for patient heterogeneity in recurrent event trajectories. Moreover, the joint model allows for dependent censoring of gap times by death or administrative reasons and for the correlations between different gap times for the same individual. It is straightforward to include covariates in the survival and/or recurrence process through the speciﬁcation of appropriate regression terms. The main advantages of the proposed methodology are wide applicability, ease of interpretation, and efﬁcient computations.

	doi = {10.1177/1740774509339238},
	abstract = {Background—It can be difficult to conduct pediatric clinical trials because there is often a low incidence of the disease in children, making accrual slow or infeasible. In addition, low mortality and morbidity in this population make it impractical to achieve adequate power. In this case, the only evidence for treatment efficacy comes from adult trials. Since pediatric care providers are accustomed to relying on evidence from adult studies, it is natural to consider borrowing information from adult trials.
Purpose—The goal of this article is to propose a Bayesian approach to the design and analysis of pediatric trials to allow borrowing strength from previous or simultaneous adult trials.
Methods—We apply a hierarchical model for which the efficacy parameter from the adult trial and that of the pediatric trail are considered to be draws from a normal distribution. The choice of (the variance of) this distribution is guided by discussion with medical experts. We show that with this information, one can calculate the sample size required for the pediatric trial. We discuss how inference of these studies in pediatric populations depends on the parameter that captures the similarity of the treatment efficacy in adults compared to children.
Results—The Bayesian approach can substantially increase the power of a pediatric clinical trial (or equivalently decrease the number of subjects required) by formally leveraging the data from the adult trial. Limitations—Our method relies on obtaining a value for the inter-study variability,, which may be difficult to describe to a clinical investigator.
Conclusions—The Bayesian approach has the potential of making pediatric clinical trials feasible because it has the effect of borrowing strength from adult trials, thus requiring a smaller pediatric trial to show efficacy of a drug in children.},

The transformation results in a domain which is [0, 1]. We model the cumulative distribution function as a mixture of Beta cumulative distribution functions, noting that the latter family is dense within the collection of all continuous densities on [0, 1]. For the fitting of the model we take a Bayesian approach, encouraging vague priors, to focus upon the likelihood. We discuss choices of such priors as well as the integrability of the resultant posteriors.

	abstract = {This paper considers the tting, criticism and comparison of three ordinal regression models \{ the cumulative, sequential and two-step models. E cient algorithms based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are developed for each model. In the case of the cumulative model, a new Metropolis-Hastings procedure to sample the cut points is proposed. This procedure relies on a simple transformation of the cut-points that leaves the transformed cut-points unordered. For comparing these models, we develop a coherent approach based on marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors. To help in the assignment of prior distributions to regression parameters and the cut-points, di erent methods for forming and representing prior beliefs are provided. One set of methods is based on the idea of a training sample and a prior imaginary sample. Another method is based on the direct assessment of distributions on the multinomial response, followed by change of variable to a distribution on the parameters of the model. All of the ideas are illustrated in two data sets, one from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth in the {US} and the other from the General Social Survey in Canada.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly deﬁned. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure {pD} for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general {pD} approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher’s information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the ‘hat’ matrix projecting observations onto ﬁtted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of ﬁt or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the ﬁt and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding {pD} to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justiﬁcation. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation ({ABC}) refers to a family of inference methods used in the Bayesian analysis of complex models where evaluation of the likelihood is difﬁcult. Conventional {ABC} methods often suﬀer from the curse of dimensionality, and a marginal adjustment strategy was recently introduced in the literature to improve the performance of {ABC} algorithms in high-dimensional problems. The marginal adjustment approach is extended using a Gaussian copula approximation. The method ﬁrst estimates the bivariate posterior for each pair of parameters separately using a 2-dimensional Gaussian copula, and then combines these estimates together to estimate the joint posterior. The approximation works well in large sample settings when the posterior is approximately normal, but also works well in many cases which are far from that situation due to the nonparametric estimation of the marginal posterior distributions. If each bivariate posterior distribution can be well estimated with a lowdimensional {ABC} analysis then this Gaussian copula method can extend {ABC} methods to problems of high dimension. The method also results in an analytic expression for the approximate posterior which is useful for many purposes such as approximation of the likelihood itself. This method is illustrated with several examples.},

Finding this dose for drug-combination trials is complicated due to drug-drug interactions, and many trial designs have been proposed to address this issue. These designs rely on complicated statistical models that typically are not familiar to clinicians, and are rarely used in practice. The aim of this paper is to propose a Bayesian dose-ﬁnding design for drug combination trials based on standard logistic regression. Under the proposed design, we continuously update the posterior estimates of the model parameters to make the decisions of dose assignment and early stopping. Simulation studies show that the proposed design is competitive and outperforms some existing designs. We also extend our design to handle delayed toxicities.},

To search for the maximum tolerated dose combination, we continuously update the posterior estimates for the toxicity probabilities of the combined doses. By reordering the dose toxicities in the two-dimensional probability space, we adaptively assign each new cohort of patients to the most appropriate dose. Dose escalation, de-escalation or staying at the same doses is determined by comparing the posterior estimates of the probabilities of toxicity of combined doses and the prespeciﬁed toxicity target.

Extreme value considerations are used to derive two further new copulas: the t extreme value copula is the limiting copula of componentwise maxima of t distributed random vectors; the t lower tail copula is the limiting copula of bivariate observations from a t distribution that are conditioned to lie below some joint threshold that is progressively lowered.

An alternate approach is to jointly model toxicity and efficacy and allow dose escalation to depend on a pre-specified efficacy/toxicity tradeoff in a phase I-{II} design. Several phase I-{II} trial designs have been discussed in the literature; while these model-based designs are attractive in their performance, they are potentially vulnerable to model misspecification.
Methods: Phase I-{II} designs often rely on copula models to specify the joint distribution of toxicity and efficacy, which include an additional correlation parameter that can be difficult to estimate. We compare and contrast three models for the joint probability of toxicity and efficacy, including two copula models that have been proposed for use in phase I-{II} clinical trials and a simple model that assumes the two outcomes are independent. We evaluate the performance of the various models through simulation both when the models are correct and under model misspecification.
Results: Both models exhibited similar performance, as measured by the probability of correctly identifying the optimal dose and the number of subjects treated at the optimal dose, regardless of whether the data were generated from the correct or incorrect copula, even when there is substantial correlation between the two outcomes. Similar results were observed for a simple model that assumes independence, even in the presence of strong correlation. Further simulation results indicate that estimating the correlation parameter in copula models is difficult with the sample sizes used in Phase I-{II} clinical trials.
Conclusions: Our simulation results indicate that the operating characteristics of phase I-{II} clinical trials are robust to misspecification of the copula model but that a simple model that assumes independence performs just as well due to difficulty in estimating the copula model correlation parameters from binary data.},

We propose a novel adaptive randomization scheme to favor assigning patients to more efficacious dose-combination arms. Our adaptive randomization scheme takes into account both the point estimate and variability of efficacy. By using a moving reference to compare the relative efficacy among treatment arms, our method achieves a high resolution to distinguish different arms. We also consider groupwise adaptive randomization when efficacy is late-onset. We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the proposed design, and illustrate our method using a phase I/{II} melanoma clinical trial.},

What is to presented is a self-contained review, mainly from a statistical point of view, of the concept of copulas vis-a-vis multivariate distributions and dependence and to motivate their utility via a number of applications to the design of clinical trials, microarray studies with survival endpoints and the analysis of dependent Receiver Operator Curves ({ROC}).},

	abstract = {Randomized Controlled Trials ({RCTs}) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in {RCTs} over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment eﬀect ({ATE}), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more diﬃcult than commonly believed. At best, an {RCT} yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justiﬁcation is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding ‘external validity’ is unhelpful because it expects too much of an {RCT} while undervaluing its potential contribution. {RCTs} do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientiﬁc progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. {RCTs} can play a role in building scientiﬁc knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not ‘what works’, but ‘why things work’.},

Particularly the issue of whether the estimation of copula parameters can be enhanced by optimizing experimental conditions and how robust all the parameter estimates for the model are with respect to the type of copula employed. In this paper an equivalence theorem for (bivariate) copula models is provided that allows formulation of eﬃcient design algorithms and quick checks of whether designs are optimal or at least eﬃcient. Some examples illustrate that in practical situations considerable gains in design eﬃciency can be achieved. A natural comparison between diﬀerent copula models with respect to design eﬃciency is provided as well.},

Copula functions are very useful tools to model different kinds of dependence with arbitrary marginal distributions. We consider Clayton and Gumbel copulae as competing association models. The focus is on applications in testing a new drug looking at both efﬁcacy and toxicity outcomes. In this context, one of the main goals is to ﬁnd the dose which maximizes the probability of efﬁcacy without toxicity, herein called P-optimal dose. If the P-optimal dose changes under the two rival copulae, then it is relevant to identify the proper association model. To this aim, we propose a criterion (called {PKL}) which enables us to ﬁnd the optimal doses to discriminate between the rival copulae, subject to a constraint that protects patients against dangerous doses. Furthermore, by applying the likelihood ratio test for non-nested models, via a simulation study we conﬁrm that the {PKL}-optimal design is really able to discriminate between the rival copulae.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}. Standard physical, neurologic, and neuropsychologic examinations may not detect abnormalities after mild traumatic brain injury ({mTBI}). An analysis of eye movements may be more sensitive to neurologic dysfunction.
{METHODS}. We performed eye tracking assessments in 71 active duty and veteran military personnel with persistent postconcussive symptoms (3 months to 5 years after {mTBI}) and 75 volunteers with no history of brain injury. Both eyes were sampled at 500 Hz and analyzed for various eye measurement parameters during visual tasks involving the saccadic and smooth systems.
{RESULTS}. No difference between {mTBI} and normal participants in main sequence proﬁles was observed. On the circular task, intersaccadic interval duration was shorter in {mTBI} compared with normal subjects (horizontal: Cohen’s D ¼ À0.65; vertical: Cohen’s D ¼ À0.75). For reading, absolute saccadic amplitudes (Cohen’s D ¼ À0.76) and average forward saccadic amplitudes were lower (Cohen’s D ¼ À0.61). Absolute ﬁxation velocity was higher (Cohen’s D ¼ 1.02), and overall ﬁxation durations (Cohen’s D ¼ 0.58), regression durations (Cohen’s D ¼ 0.49), and forward saccadic durations (Cohen’s D¼0.54) were longer. {mTBI} participants had more ﬁxations (Cohen’s D ¼ 0.54) and regressions per line (Cohen’s D ¼ 0.70) and read fewer lines (Cohen’s D ¼ À0.38) than normal subjects. On the horizontal ramp task, {mTBI} participants had lower weighted smooth pursuit gains (Cohen’s D ¼ À0.55). On the horizontal step task, {mTBI} participants had shorter mean ﬁxation times (Cohen’s D ¼ À0.55).
{CONCLUSIONS}. These results suggest vulnerability of the smooth pursuit and saccadic systems in {mTBI}. Eye tracking shows promise as an objective, sensitive assessment of damage after {mTBI}. ({ClinicalTrials}.gov number, {NCT}01611194, {NCT}01925963.)},

	abstract = {Background The need for formal and structured approaches for beneﬁt–risk assessment of medicines is increasing, as is the complexity of the scientiﬁc questions addressed before making decisions on the beneﬁt–risk balance of medicines. We systematically collected, appraised and classiﬁed available beneﬁt–risk methodologies to facilitate and inform their future use.
Methods A systematic review of publications identiﬁed beneﬁt–risk assessment methodologies. Methodologies were appraised on their fundamental principles, features, graphical representations, assessability and accessibility. We created a taxonomy of methodologies to facilitate understanding and choice.
Results We identiﬁed 49 methodologies, critically appraised and classiﬁed them into four categories: frameworks, metrics, estimation techniques and utility survey techniques. Eight frameworks describe qualitative steps in beneﬁt–risk assessment and eight quantify beneﬁt–risk balance. Nine metric indices include threshold indices to measure either beneﬁt or risk; health indices measure quality-of-life over time; and trade-off indices integrate beneﬁts and risks. Six estimation techniques support beneﬁt–risk modelling and evidence synthesis. Four utility survey techniques elicit robust value preferences from relevant stakeholders to the beneﬁt–risk decisions.
Conclusions Methodologies to help beneﬁt–risk assessments of medicines are diverse and each is associated with different limitations and strengths. There is not a ‘one-size-ﬁts-all’ method, and a combination of methods may be needed for each beneﬁt–risk assessment. The taxonomy introduced herein may guide choice of adequate methodologies. Finally, we recommend 13 of 49 methodologies for further appraisal for use in the real-life beneﬁt–risk assessment of medicines. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Existing methods pose numerous difﬁculties and none is entirely satisfactory. We propose a Bayesian method to select the most probable copula family among a given set. The copula parameters are treated as nuisance variables, and hence do not have to be estimated. Furthermore, by a parameterization of the copula density in terms of Kendall’s , the prior on the parameter is replaced by a prior on , conceptually more meaningful. The prior on , common to all families in the set of tested copulas, serves as a basis for their comparison. Using simulated data sets, we study the reliability of the method and observe the following: (1) the frequency of successful identiﬁcation approaches 100\% as the sample size increases, (2) for weakly correlated variables, larger samples are necessary for reliable identiﬁcation.},

Our method is the ﬁrst to jointly estimate the posterior distribution of all trees of a regular vine copula. This represents a substantial improvement over existing frequentist and Bayesian strategies, which can only select one tree at a time and are known to induce bias. A simulation study demonstrates the feasibility of our strategy and shows that it combines superior selection and reduced computation time compared to Bayesian tree-by-tree selection. In a real data example, we forecast the daily expected tail loss of a portfolio of nine exchange-traded funds using a fully Bayesian multivariate dynamic model built around Bayesian regular vine copulas to illustrate our model’s viability for ﬁnancial analysis and risk estimation.},

Two Monte Carlo studies are conducted to show that model identiﬁcation improves when the model parameters are jointly estimated.

	abstract = {Response adaptive randomized clinical trials have gained popularity due to their ﬂexibility for adjusting design components, including arm allocation probabilities, at any point in the trial according to the intermediate results. In the Bayesian framework, allocation probabilities to different treatment arms are commonly deﬁned as functionals of the posterior distributions of parameters of the outcome distribution for each treatment. In a non-conjugate model, however, repeated updates of the posterior distribution can be computationally intensive. In this article, we propose an adaptation of sequential Monte Carlo for efﬁciently updating the posterior distribution of parameters as new outcomes are observed in a general adaptive trial design. An efﬁcient computational tool facilitates implementation of more ﬂexible designs with more frequent interim looks that can in turn reduce the required sample size and expected number of failures in clinical trials. Moreover, more complex statistical models that reﬂect realistic modeling assumptions can be used for analysis of trial results.},

	abstract = {A design is proposed for randomized comparative trials with ordinal outcomes and prognostic subgroups. The design accounts for patient heterogeneity by allowing possibly diﬀerent comparative conclusions within subgroups. The comparative testing criterion is based on utilities for the levels of the ordinal outcome and a Bayesian probability model. Designs based on two alternative models that include treatment-subgroup interactions are considered, the proportional odds model and a non-proportional odds model with a hierarchical prior that shrinks toward the proportional odds model. A third design that assumes homogeneity and ignores possible treatment-subgroup interactions also is considered. The three approaches are applied to construct group sequential designs for a trial of nutritional prehabilitation versus standard of care for esophageal cancer patients undergoing chemoradiation and surgery, including both untreated patients and salvage patients whose disease has recurred following previous therapy. A simulation study is presented that compares the three designs, including evaluation of within-subgroup type I and {II} error probabilities under a variety of scenarios including diﬀerent combinations of treatment-subgroup interactions.},

	abstract = {We develop efficient Bayesian inference for the one-factor copula model with two significant contributions over existing methodologies. First, our approach leads to straightforward inference on dependence parameters and the latent factor; only inference on the former is available under frequentist alternatives. Second, we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that averages over models constructed from different bivariate copula building blocks. Our approach accommodates any combination of discrete and continuous margins. Through extensive simulations, we compare the computational and Monte Carlo efficiency of alternative proposed sampling schemes. The preferred algorithm provides reliable inference on parameters, the latent factor, and model space. The potential of the methodology is highlighted in an empirical study of 10 binary measures of socio-economic deprivation collected for 11,463 East Timorese households. The importance of conducting inference on the latent factor is motivated by constructing a poverty index using estimates of the factor. Compared to a linear Gaussian factor model, our model average improves out-of-sample fit. The relationships between the poverty index and observed variables uncovered by our approach are diverse and allow for a richer and more precise understanding of the dependence between overall deprivation and individual measures of well-being.},

We present statistical methods for incorporating audit results into analyses. This can be thought of as a measurement error problem, where the distribution of errors is a mixture with a point mass at 0. If the error rate is nonzero, then even if the mean of the discrepancy between the reported and correct values of a predictor is 0, naive estimates of the association between two continuous variables will be biased. We consider scenarios where there are (1) errors in the predictor, (2) errors in the outcome, and (3) possibly correlated errors in the predictor and outcome. We show how to incorporate the error rate and magnitude, estimated from a random subset (the audited records), to compute unbiased estimates of association and proper conﬁdence intervals. We then extend these results to multiple linear regression where multiple covariates may be incorrect in the database and the rate and magnitude of the errors may depend on study site. We study the ﬁnite sample properties of our estimators using simulations, discuss some practical considerations, and illustrate our methods with data from 2815 {HIV}-infected patients in Latin America, of whom 234 had their data audited using a sequential auditing plan.},

Conditional copula models are ﬂexible tools for modelling complex dependence structures. We construct Bayesian inference for the conditional copula model adapted to regression settings in which the bivariate outcome is continuous or mixed (binary and continuous) and the copula parameter varies with covariate values. The functional relationship between the copula parameter and the covariate is modelled using cubic splines. We also extend our work to additive models which would allow us to handle more than one covariate while keeping the computational burden within reasonable limits. We perform the proposed joint Bayesian inference via adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The deviance information criterion and cross-validated marginal log-likelihood criterion are employed for three model selection problems: 1) choosing the copula family that best ﬁts the data, 2) selecting the calibration function, i.e., checking if parametric form for copula parameter is suitable and 3) determining the number of independent variables in the additive model. The performance of the estimation and model selection techniques are investigated via simulations and demonstrated on two data sets: 1) Matched Multiple Birth and 2) Burn Injury. In which of interest is the inﬂuence of gestational age and maternal age on twin birth weights in the former data, whereas in the later data we are interested in investigating how patient’s age aﬀects the severity of burn injury and the probability of death.},

Often experiments are performed that have multiple dependent responses described by regression type models, and it is of interest and of value to design the experiment for all these responses. This requires a multivariate distribution underlying a pre-chosen model for the data. Here, we consider the design of experiments for bivariate binary data which are dependent. We explore Copula functions which provide a rich and flexible class of structures to derive joint distributions for bivariate binary data. We present methods for deriving optimal experimental designs for dependent bivariate binary data using Copulas, and demonstrate that, by including the dependence between responses in the design process, more efficient parameter estimates are obtained than by the usual practice of simply designing for a single variable only. Further, we investigate the robustness of designs with respect to initial parameter estimates and Copula function, and also show the performance of compound criteria within this bivariate binary setting.},

Common examples of such models include exponential random graph models for social networks and Markov point processes for ecology and disease modeling. Inference for these models is complicated because the normalizing functions of their probability distributions include the parameters of interest. In Bayesian analysis, they result in so-called doubly intractable posterior distributions which pose significant computational challenges. Several Monte Carlo methods have emerged in recent years to address Bayesian inference for such models. We provide a framework for understanding the algorithms, and elucidate connections among them. Through multiple simulated and real data examples, we compare and contrast the computational and statistical efficiency of these algorithms and discuss their theoretical bases. Our study provides practical recommendations for practitioners along with directions for future research for Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) methodologists.

This essentially leads to a multivariate analogue of the univariate {GLM} theory and hence an eﬃciency gain in the estimation of regression coeﬃcients. The availability of joint probability models enables us to develop a full maximum likelihood inference. Numerical illustrations are focused on regression models for discrete correlated data, including multidimensional logistic regression models and a joint model for mixed normal and binary outcomes. In the simulation studies, the proposed copula-based joint model is compared to the popular generalized estimating equations, which is a moment-based estimating equation method to join univariate {GLMs}.

Specifically, the Multisite {HIV}/{STD} Prevention Trial for African American Couples is a behavioral modification trial for African American, heterosexual, {HIV} discordant couples. In this trial, investigators developed and evaluated a couple-based behavioral intervention for reducing risky shared sexual behaviors and collected retrospective outcomes from both partners at baseline and at 3 follow-ups to evaluate the intervention efficacy. As the outcomes refer to the couples' shared sexual behavior, couples' responses are expected to be correlated, and modeling approaches should account for multiple sources of correlation: within-individual over time as well as within-couple both at the same measurement time and at different times. This dissertation details the novel application copulas to modeling dyadic, longitudinal binary data to estimate reliability and efficacy. Copulas have long been analytic tools for modeling multivariate outcomes in other settings. Particularly, we selected a mixture of max-infinitely divisible (max-id) copula because it has a number of attractive analytic features.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes ﬁnite mixtures of different Archimedean copula families as a ﬂexible tool for modelling the dependence structure in multivariate data. A novel approach to estimating the parameters in this mixture model is presented by maximizing the penalized marginal likelihood via iterative quadratic programming. The motivation for the penalized marginal likelihood stems from an underlying Bayesian model that imposes a prior distribution on the parameter of each Archimedean copula family. An approximative marginal likelihood is obtained by a classical quadrature discretization of the integral w.r.t. each family-speciﬁc prior distribution, thus yielding a ﬁnite mixture model. Family-speciﬁc smoothness penalties are added and the penalized marginal likelihood is maximized using an iterative quadratic programming routine. For comparison purposes, we also present a fully Bayesian approach via simulation-based posterior computation. The performance of the novel estimation approach is evaluated by simulations and two examples involving the modelling of the interdependence of exchange rates and of wind speed measurements, respectively. For these examples, penalized marginal likelihood estimates are compared to the corresponding Bayesian estimates.},

However, they are rarely considered in the experimental design context, particularly in a Bayesian framework where model and parameter uncertainty are considered. In this work, a variety of such models are explored, which explain dependence structures in experiments where bivariate discrete and mixed responses are observed. A sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is adopted to reduce the computational eﬀort required in deriving sequential designs. Further, the performance of the total entropy utility function is evaluated under diﬀerent Copula models, which allows us to derive designs for the dual objectives of parameter estimation and model discrimination for Copula models. The results show that the total entropy utility function appears to estimate parameters equally well for all Copula models considered, and it is possible to discriminate between all Copula models considered despite having similar tail dependence. However, for experiments which yield binary and continuous data, it may require observing a large number of data points (around 1000) to discriminate between some Copula models, and this may not be possible in practice.},

However, these models have been rarely applied in more than one dimension. Indeed, implementation in the multivariate case is inherently difficult due to the rapidly increasing number of parameters needed to characterize the joint dependence structure accurately. In this paper, we propose a factorization scheme of multivariate dependence structures based on the copula modeling framework, whereby each marginal dimension in the mixing parameter space is modeled separately and the marginals are then linked by a nonparametric random copula function. Specifically, we consider nonparametric univariate Gaussian mixtures for the marginals and a multivariate random Bernstein polynomial copula for the link function, under the Dirichlet process prior. We show that in a multivariate setting this scheme leads to an improvement in the precision of a density estimate relative to the commonly used multivariate Gaussian mixture. We derive weak posterior consistency of the copula-based mixing scheme for general kernel types under high-level conditions, and strong posterior consistency for the specific Bernstein–Gaussian mixture model.},

First, expressing the joint dependence structure in terms of bivariate copulas leads to a computationally advantageous expression for the likelihood function. This makes maximum likelihood estimation feasible for large multidimensional data sets. Second, different and possibly asymmetric bivariate (conditional) marginal distributions are allowed which is necessary to accurately describe the limiting behavior of conditional distributions for mixed discrete and continuous responses.

As previous authors stated, "A copula is a function which joins or “couples” a multivariate distribution function to its one-dimensional marginal distribution functions. Given that cost and effectiveness are often related to each other and therefore they show statistical dependence, the use of copulas to handle uncertainty caused by sampling variation could be potentially useful when costeffectiveness analyses ({CEA}) are performed using patient-level data. The objective of this study was to empirically compare various copula distributions with two traditional methods, namely, the bootstrapping approach and the Bayesian approach assuming that incremental cost and {LYs} gained are bivariate normally distributed.
Methods: The patient-level data from a previously published observational study were analyzed using four copula distributions: independent, Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern ({FGM}), Frank and Clayton copulas. Using the results from the traditional methods previously published, models were compared in terms of incremental cost, incremental life years ({LYs}) gained and the costeffectiveness acceptability curves ({CEACs}) based on the net monetary benefit ({NMB}).
Results: Using the traditional methods provided similar results. The most pronounced impact was the improvement in precision given that the confidence intervals were so much narrower for the copulas methods in comparison to the traditional methods. Consequently, the probability of being optimal derived from the Frank and Clayton copulas were close to 1.0 at a willingness to pay (������) of {CA}\$20,000. By contrast, the traditional methods were optimal for a ������ of \$100,000 {CAD}.
Conclusions: The results of this study demonstreate the potential impact and importance of copulas in patient-level cost-effectiveness analysis. This approach could be particularly important in those situations where the data suggests some kind of dependence and some restrictions on the marginals, as observed in our case study.},

	abstract = {Multivariate analysis involving random variables of diﬀerent type like count, continuous or mixture of both is frequently required in economics. A Copula based methodology can be adopted for such data, where the association among the random variables is independent to their speciﬁc marginal distributions. Depending upon the chosen marginal speciﬁcations, copula estimation proceeds. A semi-parametric copula estimation, where the marginals are speciﬁed empirically performs very well, but for discrete data it’s appropriateness is questioned (see Genest et al. (1995)). Hoﬀ (2007) proposes a methodology where the marginal distributions are left completely unspeciﬁed and the copula parameters are estimated based on the order statistics of the observed data. We conduct an analysis to determine the eﬀect on the estimates of a gaussian copula due to various marginal speciﬁcations. Employing a bayesian framework, we ﬁnd that treating marginal distribution as unknown outperforms empirically distributed margins and misspeciﬁed margins in terms of biasedness and mean square error in small samples.},

In this paper, we present a parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) algorithm in which subsets of data are processed independently, with very little communication. First, we arbitrarily partition data onto multiple machines. Then, on each machine, any classical {MCMC} method (e.g., Gibbs sampling) may be used to draw samples from a posterior distribution given the data subset. Finally, the samples from each machine are combined to form samples from the full posterior. This embarrassingly parallel algorithm allows each machine to act independently on a subset of the data (without communication) until the ﬁnal combination stage. We prove that our algorithm generates asymptotically exact samples and empirically demonstrate its ability to parallelize burn-in and sampling in several models.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference ({VI}), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. {VI} has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind {VI} is to ﬁrst posit a family of densities and then to ﬁnd the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-ﬁeld variational inference, discuss the special case of {VI} applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in {VI} and highlight important open problems. {VI} is powerful, but it is not yet well understood.

The method uses dynamic graphical displays of probability distributions that can be freehand adjusted. The method was developed for, and is applied to, a randomized trial comparing prophylaxes for toxoplasmosis in a population of {HIV}-positive individuals. Prior distributions from five {AIDS} experts are elicited. The experts represent a community of consumers of the results of the trial and these prior distributions can be used to try to make the monitoring and analysis of the trial robust.},

It can be used for univariate (independent) failure times, i.e. to describe the influence of unobserved covariates in a {proportiOnal} hazards model. More interesting, however, is to consider multivariate (dependent) failure times generated as conditionally independent times given the frailty. This approach can be used both for survival times for individuals, like twins or family members, and for repeated events for the same individual. The standard assumption is to use a gamma distribution for the frailty, but this is a restriction that implies that the dependence is most important for late events. More generally, the distribution can be stable, inverse Gaussian, or follow a power variance function exponential family. Theoretically, large differences are seen between the choices. In practice, using the largest model makes it possible to allow for more general de{\textasciitilde}ndence structures, without making the formulas too complicated.},

	abstract = {A major challenge in genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) is to derive the multiple testing threshold when hypothesis tests are conducted using a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Permutation tests are considered the gold standard in multiple testing adjustment in genetic association studies. However, it is computationally intensive, especially for {GWASs}, and can be impractical if a large number of random shuffles are used to ensure accuracy. Many researchers have developed approximation algorithms to relieve the computing burden imposed by permutation. One particularly attractive alternative to permutation is to calculate the effective number of independent tests, Meff, which has been shown to be promising in genetic association studies. In this study, we compare recently developed Meff methods and validate them by the permutation test with 10,000 random shuffles using two real {GWAS} data sets: an Illumina 1M {BeadChip} and an Affymetrix {GeneChip}® Human Mapping 500K Array Set. Our results show that the {simpleM} method produces the best approximation of the permutation threshold, and it does so in the shortest amount of time. We also show that Meff is indeed valid on a genome-wide scale in these data sets based on statistical theory and significance tests. The significance thresholds derived can provide practical guidelines for other studies using similar population samples and genotyping platforms.},

The approach uses pairwise comparisons between patients in the treatment and control groups using a primary 10 outcome, say the time to death, with ties broken using a secondary outcome, say the time to hospitalization. In general the observed pairwise preferences and the weight they attach to the component rankings will depend on the distribution of potential follow-up time. We present expressions for the win and loss probabilities for general bivariate survival models when followup of all patients is limited to a speciﬁed time horizon. In the special case of a bivariate Lehmann 15 model we show that the win ratio does not depend on this horizon. We show how the win ratio may be estimated non-parametrically or from a parametric model. Extensions to events of three or more types are described. Application of the method of marginal estimation due to Wei et al. (1989) to this problem is described.},

	abstract = {Background—To assess concomitant simultaneous effects on multiple end points using global statistical methods in phase {II} acute heart failure studies.
Methods and Results—Using simulations we have assessed different statistical methods to evaluate concomitant effects of a new intervention on dyspnea relief (using 2 measures), length of hospital stay, worsening heart failure to 5 days, mortality, and heart failure readmission to 30 days. Treatment effect scenarios included large (20\% to 28\% relative improvements) and very large (30\% to 43\% relative improvements) effects among others. Placebo responses and correlations among end points typical in recent acute heart failure clinical trials were used. Powers for the average Z score exceeded 70\% with ≥75 patients per group for 35\% relative improvement across all 6 end points. Assessing dyspnea alone generally provides lower power than the average Z score approach, with power deducted ≈50\% under most of scenarios. Other approaches generally provide lower power than the average Z score method.
Conclusions—Assessing the effects of new therapies on multiple clinical end points using the average Z score enables detection of therapeutic efficacy using sample sizes of 100 to 150 patients per group, approximately double the power achievable assessing the effects on dyspnea alone.  (Circ Heart Fail. 2012;5:742–749.)},

	abstract = {Clinical triallists are often reluctant to alter the protocol or the design of an ongoing study in part because of concern that changes may a ect the integrity of the study. This paper encourages considering changes in long-term clinical trials when the medical environment changes or when the accruing data from the trial lead to questioning the assumptions underlying the original design. One must make such changes in a way that will not cast doubt on the integrity of the trial. An important aspect of the design is choice of sample size. Methodology for sample size recalculation has matured over the decade. Several techniques are now available for the usual types of endpoints – continuous, discrete and time-to-failure – as well as for longitudinal analysis. Published papers describe the choices of variance at the time of recalculation, approaches to estimation and testing at the end of the study, and the time of recalculation. In a study with a sponsor, a Data Safety Monitoring Board ({DSMB}) and an Executive Committee, one or more of these three groups is responsible for recommending increases in sample size when the accruing data indicate that the assumed variance underestimated the true variance. Sometimes a statistician independent of all three bodies performs the relevant calculations and sends the recommendation to the sponsor. This paper argues that the {DSMB} should not generally be the responsible body because knowledge of treatment e ect can place it in an uncomfortable position.

	abstract = {Composite endpoints are commonly used in cardiovascular clinical trials. When using a composite endpoint a subject is considered to have an event when the first component endpoint has occurred. The use of composite endpoints offers the ability to incorporate several clinically important endpoint events thereby augmenting the event rate and increasing statistical power for a given sample size. One assumption of the composite is that all component events are of equal clinical importance. This assumption is rarely achieved given the diversity of component endpoints included. One means of adjusting for this diversity is to adjust the outcomes using severity weights determined a priori. The use of a weighted endpoint also allows for the incorporation of multiple endpoints per patient. Although weighting the outcomes lowers the effective number of events, it offers additional information that reduces the variance of the estimate. We created a series of simulation studies to examine the effect on power as the individual components of a typical composite were changed. In one study, we noted that the weighted composite was able to offer discriminative power when the component outcomes were altered, while the traditional method was not. In the other study, we noted that the weighted composite offered a similar level of power to the traditional composite when the change was driven by the more severe endpoints.},

	abstract = {Background—Heart failure–related hospital readmissions and mortality are often outcomes in clinical trials. Patients may experience multiple hospital readmissions over time with mortality acting as a dependent terminal event. Univariate composite end points are used for the analysis of readmissions. We may amend these approaches to include emergency department visits as a further outcome. An alternative multivariate modeling approach that categorizes hospital readmissions and emergency department visits as separate event types is proposed.
Methods and Results—We seek to compare the modeling approach which handles event types as separate, correlated end points against composites that amalgamate them to create a unified end point. Using a heart failure data set for illustration, a model with random effects for event types is estimated. The time-to-first event, unmatched win-ratio, and days-aliveand-out-of-hospital composites are derived for comparison. The model provides supplementary statistics such as the correlation among event types and yields considerably more power than the competing composite end points.
Conclusions—The effect on individual outcomes is lost when they are intermingled to form a univariate composite. Simultaneously modeling different outcomes provides an alternative or supplementary analysis that may yield greater statistical power and additional insights. Improvements in software have made the multitype events model easier to implement and thus a useful, more efficient option when analyzing heart failure hospital readmissions and emergency department visits.  (Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2017;10:e003382. {DOI}: 10.1161/{CIRCOUTCOMES}.116.003382.)},

We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the p values corresponding to intervals of ﬁxed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efﬁcient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

	shorttitle = {Bayesian inference with Stan},
	abstract = {When evaluating cognitive models based on fits to observed data (or, really, any model that has free parameters), parameter estimation is critically important. Traditional techniques like hill climbing by minimizing or maximizing a fit statistic often result in point estimates. Bayesian approaches instead estimate parameters as posterior probability distributions, and thus naturally account for the uncertainty associated with parameter estimation; Bayesian approaches also offer powerful and principled methods for model comparison. Although software applications such as {WinBUGS} (Lunn, Thomas, Best, \& Spiegelhalter, Statistics and Computing, 10, 325–337, 2000) and {JAGS} (Plummer, 2003) provide Bturnkey{\textasciicircum}-style packages for Bayesian inference, they can be inefficient when dealing with models whose parameters are correlated, which is often the case for cognitive models, and they can impose significant technical barriers to adding custom distributions, which is often necessary when implementing cognitive models within a Bayesian framework. A recently developed software package called Stan (Stan Development Team, 2015) can solve both problems, as well as provide a turnkey solution to Bayesian inference. We present a tutorial on how to use Stan and how to add custom distributions to it, with an example using the linear ballistic accumulator model (Brown \& Heathcote, Cognitive Psychology, 57, 153–178. doi:10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.002, 2008).},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an eﬀect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect eﬀects (i.e., loss of power, Type {II} errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of eﬀects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-ﬁre way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their ﬂexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

Furthermore, we generalize this strategy for jointly modeling the dependencies between mixed responses in regression mixed models. The proposed method allows the adoption of ﬂexible discrete margins and copula functions for various types of data. Maximum likelihood is used for model estimation; particularly, the estimation for bivariate responses in copula-based regression mixed models can be implemented using the {SAS} {PROC} {NLMIXED} procedure via adaptive Gaussian quadrature. In addition, a mixed model with non-Gaussian random eﬀects can also be easily ﬁtted using the same {SAS} procedure after reformulating the likelihood function by multiplying and dividing by a Gaussian density. Simulation results show good performance for bivariate discrete or mixed outcomes ranging from noncorrelated to highly correlated responses. An analysis of student performance in California schools shows a drastic improvement in estimation precision from the joint model versus two independent ﬁts.},

	abstract = {Background: The objective of phase {II} cancer clinical trials is to determine if a treatment has sufficient activity to warrant further study. The efficiency of a conventional phase {II} trial design has been the object of considerable debate, particularly when the study regimen is characteristically cytostatic. At the time of development of a phase {II} cancer trial, we accumulated clinical experience regarding the time to progression ({TTP}) for similar classes of drugs and for standard therapy. By considering the time to event ({TTE}) in addition to the tumor response endpoint, a mixed-endpoint phase {II} design may increase the efficiency and ability of selecting promising cytotoxic and cytostatic agents for further development.
Methods: We proposed a single-arm phase {II} trial design by extending the Zee multinomial method to fully use mixed endpoints with tumor response and the {TTE}. In this design, the dependence between the probability of response and the {TTE} outcome is modeled through a Gaussian copula.
Results: Given the type I and type {II} errors and the hypothesis as defined by the response rate ({RR}) and median {TTE}, such as median {TTP}, the decision rules for a two-stage phase {II} trial design can be generated. We demonstrated through simulation that the proposed design has a smaller expected sample size and higher early stopping probability under the null hypothesis than designs based on a single-response endpoint or a single {TTE} endpoint.
Conclusions: The proposed design is more efficient for screening new cytotoxic or cytostatic agents and less likely to miss an effective agent than the alternative single-arm design.},

We assume multivariate normal linear regression models for multivariate continuous measures, multivariate probit models for correlated ordinal measures, and multivariate multinomial probit models for multivariate categorical/nominal measures. Then we assume a multivariate normal linear model on the continuous vector comprised of continuous variables and those underlying normal variables for ordinal variables from multivariate probit models and for categorical variables from multinomial probit models. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) algorithm to estimate unknown parameters including regression parameters, cut-points for ordinal data from the multivariate probit models, and the covariance matrix encompassing both continuous variables and the underlying normal latent variables. Combining the continuous variables and the normal latent variables allows us to model combinations of continuous, ordinal, and categorical multivariate data simultaneously. The framework incorporates flexible priors for the covariance matrix, provides a foundation for inference about the underlying covariance structure, and imputes missing data where needed. The method is illustrated through simulated examples and two real data applications.},

	abstract = {In clinical trials, a surrogate outcome (S) can be measured before the outcome of interest (T) and may provide early information regarding the treatment (Z) effect on T. Many methods of surrogacy validation rely on models for the conditional distribution of T given Z and S. However, S is a post-randomization variable, and unobserved, simultaneous predictors of S and T may exist, resulting in a non-causal interpretation. Frangakis and Rubin developed the concept of principal surrogacy, stratifying on the joint distribution of the surrogate marker under treatment and control to assess the association between the causal effects of treatment on the marker and the causal effects of treatment on the clinical outcome. Working within the principal surrogacy framework, we address the scenario of an ordinal categorical variable as a surrogate for a censored failure time true endpoint. A Gaussian copula model is used to model the joint distribution of the potential outcomes of T, given the potential outcomes of S. Because the proposed model cannot be fully identified from the data, we use a Bayesian estimation approach with prior distributions consistent with reasonable assumptions in the surrogacy assessment setting. The method is applied to data from a colorectal cancer clinical trial, previously analyzed by Burzykowski et al.},

However, this impressive evolution in capacity is confronted by an even steeper increase in the complexity of the datasets to be addressed. The difﬁculties of modelling and then handling ever more complex datasets most likely call for a new type of tool for computational inference that dramatically reduces the dimension and size of the raw data while capturing its essential aspects.

Thinking about the title early—and regularly returning to hone it—can help not only the writing of the paper but also the process of designing experiments or developing theories. This Rule of One is the most difficult rule to optimally implement because it comes face-toface with the key challenge of science, which is to make the claim and/or model as simple as the data and logic can support but no simpler. In the end, your struggle to find this balance may appropriately result in “one contribution” that is multifaceted. For example, a technology paper may describe both its new technology and a biological result using it; the bridge that unifies these two facets is a clear description of how the new technology can be used to do new biology.},

In the present paper, we model multivariate binary data based on copulas using mixtures of max-inﬁnitely divisible copulas, introduced by Joe and Hu (J. Multivar. Anal. 1996; 57(2): 240–265). When applying copulas to binary data the marginal distributions also contribute to the dependence measures. We propose the use of covariate information in the copula parameters to obtain a direct effect of a covariate on dependence. To deal with model uncertainty due to selecting among several candidate models, we use a model averaging technique. We apply the model to data from the {SignalTandmobiel} c dental study and, in particular, to four binary responses that refer to caries experience in the mandibular and maxillary left and right molars. We aim to model Kendall’s tau associations between them, and examine how covariate information affects these associations. We found that there are systematically larger associations between the two mandibular and the two maxillary molars. Using covariates to model these associations more closely, we found that the systematic ﬂuoride and age of the children affect the associations. Note that such relationships could not have been revealed by methods that focus on the marginal models. Copyright q 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

For the multivariate Archimedean copula, we relate the tail heaviness of a positive random variable to the tail behavior of the Archimedean copula constructed from the Laplace transform of the random variable, and extend the results of Charpentier and Segers [7] [A. Charpentier, J. Segers, Tails of multivariate Archimedean copulas, Journal of Multivariate Analysis 100 (7) (2009) 1521–1537] for upper tails of Archimedean copulas. In addition, a new one-parameter Archimedean copula family based on the Laplace transform of the inverse Gamma distribution is proposed; it possesses patterns of upper and lower tails not seen in commonly used copula families.

The common approach to inference is to model each outcome separately ignoring the potential correlation among the responses. We describe and contrast several full likelihood and quasilikelihood multivariate methods for non-commensurate outcomes. We present a new multivariate model to analyze binary and continuous correlated outcomes using a latent variable. We study the efﬁciency gains of the multivariate methods relative to the univariate approach. For complete data, all approaches yield consistent parameter estimates. When the mean structure of all outcomes depends on the same set of covariates, efﬁciency gains by adopting a multivariate approach are negligible. In contrast, when the mean outcomes depend on different covariate sets, large efﬁciency gains are realized. Three real examples illustrate the different approaches.

	abstract = {Objective: Multiple outcomes are commonly analyzed in randomized trials. Interpretation of the results of trials with many outcomes is not always straightforward. We characterize the prevalence and factors associated with multiple outcomes in reports of clinical trials of depression, methods used to account for these outcomes, and concordance between published analyses and original protocol specifications.
Methods: A {PubMed} search for randomized controlled depression trials that included multiple outcomes published between January 2007 and October 2008 in 6 medical journals. Original study protocols were reviewed where available. Parallel data collection by 2 abstractors was used to determine trial registration information, the number of outcomes, and analytical method.
Results: Of the 55 included trials, nearly half of the papers reported more than 1 primary outcome, while almost all (90.9\%, n = 50) reported more than 2 combined primary or secondary outcomes. Relatively few of the studies (5.8\%, n = 3) adjusted for multiple outcomes. While most studies had published protocols in clinical trial registries (76.4\%, n = 42), many did not specify outcomes in the protocol (n = 11) and a number had discrepancies with the published report.
Conclusions: Multiple outcomes are prevalent in randomized controlled depression trials and appropriate statistical analyses to account for these methods are rarely used. Not all studies filed protocols, and there were discrepancies between these protocols and published reports. These issues complicate interpretability of trial results, and in some cases may lead to spurious conclusions. Promulgation of guidelines to improve analysis and reporting of multiple outcomes is warranted.},

Dependence and tail properties of the model are obtained. The factor copula model can handle multivariate data with tail dependence and tail asymmetry, properties that the multivariate normal copula does not possess. It is a good choice for modeling high-dimensional data as a parametric form can be specified to have O(d) dependence parameters instead of O(d2) parameters.

	abstract = {Composite binary endpoints are increasingly used as primary endpoints in clinical trials. When designing a trial, it is crucial to determine the appropriate sample size for testing the statistical differences between treatment groups for the primary endpoint. As shown in this work, when using a composite binary endpoint to size a trial, one needs to specify the event rates and the effect sizes of the composite components as well as the correlation between them. In practice, the marginal parameters of the components can be obtained from previous studies or pilot trials; however, the correlation is often not previously reported and thus usually unknown. We first show that the sample size for composite binary endpoints is strongly dependent on the correlation and, second, that slight deviations in the prior information on the marginal parameters may result in underpowered trials for achieving the study objectives at a pre-specified significance level. We propose a general strategy for calculating the required sample size when the correlation is not specified and accounting for uncertainty in the marginal parameter values. We present the web platform {CompARE} to characterize composite endpoints and to calculate the sample size just as we propose in this paper. We evaluate the performance of the proposal with a simulation study and illustrate it by means of a real case study using {CompARE}.},

Each copula (n-copula) represents the whole class of continuous bivariate (multivariate) distributions from which it has been obtained when one-dimensional marginals were transformed by their cdf's. The similar property, however, does not hold when the original distributions are discrete, or mixed discrete-continuous. After the transformation by marginal cdf's the copula is not uniquely defined and consequently cannot be used for dependence studies analogously as in the continuous case. In this paper we will discuss grade transformation which, being an extension of probability integral transform, enables unique copula (or n-copula) representation of a multivariate distribution of any type for which cdf can be defined. We will also present how formulas of Kendall's r, Spearman's p, and Gini correlation can be written for variables continuous or not using smoothed cdf's instead of original ones.},

Prac- titioners trained in traditional, frequentist statistical methods appear to have been drawn to Bayesian approaches for three reasons. One is that Bayesian approaches implemented with the majority of their informative content coming from the current data, and not any external prior informa- tion, typically have good frequentist properties (e.g., low mean squared er- ror in repeated use). Second, these methods as now readily implemented in {WinBUGS} and other {MCMC}-driven software packages now oʼer the simplest approach to hierarchical (random eʼects) modeling, as routinely needed in longitudinal, frailty, spatial, time series, and a wide variety of other settings featuring interdependent data. Third, practitioners are attracted by the greater ʻexibility and adaptivity of the Bayesian approach, which permits stopping for ełcacy, toxicity, and futility, as well as facilitates a straightforward solution to a great many other specialized problems such as dose-nding, adaptive randomization, equivalence testing, and others we shall describe.

	abstract = {Non-linear relationships between two variables are often detected as a result of a preliminary statistical test for linearity. Common approaches to dealing with non-linearity are to (a)make a linearizing transformation in the independent variable or (b) fit a relationship that is non-linear in the independent variable, such as including a quadratic term. With either approach, the resulting test for association between the two variables can have an inflated type I error. We consider testing the significance of the quadratic term in a quadratic model as a preliminary test for non-linearity. Using simulation experiments and asymptotic arguments, we quantify the type I error inflation and suggest simple modifications of standard practice to protect the size of the type I error. In the case of quadratic regression, the type I error will be increased by roughly 50 per cent. The simple strategy of appropriately correcting the a-level is shown to have minimal loss of power if the relationship is truly linear. In the case of a linearizing transformation, the impact on the type I error will depend on the values of the independent variable and on the set of potential linearizing transformations considered. Simulation results suggest that a procedure which adjusts the test statistic according to the results of the preliminary test may offer adequate protection.},

In order to estimate the functional relationship between the copula parameter and the covariate, we propose a nonparametric approach based on local likelihood. Of importance is also the choice of the copula family that best represents a given set of data. The proposed framework naturally leads to a novel copula selection method based on cross-validated prediction errors. We derive the asymptotic bias and variance of the resulting local polynomial estimator, and outline how to construct pointwise confidence intervals.

The dependence structure between two variables can be highly influenced by a covariate, and it is of real interest to know how this dependence structure changes with the value taken by the covariate. This motivates the need for introducing conditional copulas, and the associated conditional Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s rho association measures. After the introduction and motivation of these concepts, two nonparametric estimators for a conditional copula are proposed and discussed. Then nonparametric estimates for the conditional association measures are derived. A key issue is that these measures are now looked at as functions in the covariate. The performances of all estimators are investigated via a simulation study which also includes a data-driven algorithm for choosing the smoothing parameters.

We show that this framework facilitates a non-parametric estimator of each additive component, obtained by maximizing the likelihood. The procedure is free of tuning parameters and under mild conditions is proved to be uniformly consistent on compact intervals. More generally, our methodology can be applied to generalized additive index models. Here again, the procedure can be justiﬁed on theoretical grounds and, like the original algorithm, has highly competitive ﬁnite sample performance. Practical utility is illustrated through the use of these methods in the analysis of two real data sets. Our algorithms are publicly available in the R package scar, short for shape-constrained additive regression.},

They have applications to many fields, such as medicine, economics and finance. However, most existing methods based on least squares or likelihood are sensitive when there are outliers or the error distribution is heavy tailed. Although an M-type regression is often considered as a good alternative to those methods, it may lose efficiency for normal errors. In this paper, we propose a new robust and efficient estimation procedure based on local modal regression for single index models. The asymptotic normality of proposed estimators for both the parametric and nonparametric parts is established. We show that the proposed estimators are as asymptotically efficient as the least-squarebased estimators when there are no outliers and the error distribution is normal. A modified {EM} algorithm is presented for efficient implementation. The simulations and real data analysis are conducted to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed method. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A requirement for calculating sample sizes for cluster randomized trials ({CRTs}) conducted over multiple periods of time is the specification of a form for the correlation between outcomes of subjects within the same cluster, encoded via the within-cluster correlation structure. Previously proposed within-cluster correlation structures have made strong assumptions; for example, the usual assumption is that correlations between the outcomes of all pairs of subjects are identical (“uniform correlation”). More recently, structures that allow for a decay in correlation between pairs of outcomes measured in different periods have been suggested. However, these structures are overly simple in settings with continuous recruitment and measurement. We propose a more realistic “continuous-time correlation decay” structure whereby correlations between subjects' outcomes decay as the time between these subjects' measurement times increases. We investigate the use of this structure on trial planning in the context of a primary care diabetes trial, where there is evidence of decaying correlation between pairs of patients' outcomes over time. In particular, for a range of different trial designs, we derive the variance of the treatment effect estimator under continuous-time correlation decay and compare this to the variance obtained under uniform correlation. For stepped wedge and cluster randomized crossover designs, incorrectly assuming uniform correlation will underestimate the required sample size under most trial configurations likely to occur in practice. Planning of {CRTs} requires consideration of the most appropriate within-cluster correlation structure to obtain a suitable sample size.},

In this framework, sequential testing strategies are widely accepted statistical tools in practice. Since performances of parametric sequential testing procedures vitally depend on the validity of the parametric assumptions regarding underlying data distributions, we focus on distribution-free mechanisms for sequentially evaluating treatment effects. In fixed sample size designs, the density-based empirical likelihood ({DBEL}) methods provide powerful nonparametric approximations to optimal Neyman-Pearson–type statistics. In this article, we extend the {DBEL} methodology to develop a novel sequential {DBEL} testing procedure for detecting treatment effects based on paired data. The asymptotic consistency of the proposed test is shown. An extensive Monte Carlo study confirms that the proposed test outperforms the conventional sequential Wilcoxon signed-rank test across a variety of alternatives. The excellent applicability of the proposed method is exemplified using the ventilator-associated pneumonia study that evaluates the effect of Chlorhexidine Gluconate treatment in reducing oral colonization by pathogens in ventilated patients.},

A general principle to construct test procedures that control the family-wise Type I error rate in the strong sense is based on combination tests within a closed test. Using survival data, a problem arises when using information of patients for adaptive decision making, which are under risk at interim. With the currently available testing procedures, either no testing of hypotheses in interim analyses is possible or there are restrictions on the interim data that can be used in the adaptation decisions as, essentially, only the interim test statistics of the primary endpoint may be used. We propose a general adaptive testing procedure, covering multiarmed and enrichment designs, which does not have these restrictions. An important application are clinical trials, where short-term surrogate endpoints are used as basis for trial adaptations, and we illustrate how such trials can be designed. We propose statistical models to assess the impact of effect sizes, the correlation structure between the short-term and the primary endpoint, the sample size, the timing of interim analyses, and the selection rule on the operating characteristics.},

Several extensions of g-priors to generalized linear models ({GLMs}) have been proposed in the literature; however, the choice of prior distribution of g and resulting properties for inference have received considerably less attention. In this article, we unify mixtures of g-priors in {GLMs} by assigning the truncated Compound Confluent Hypergeometric ({tCCH}) distribution to 1/(1 + g), which encompasses as special cases several mixtures of g-priors in the literature, such as the hyper-g, Beta-prime, truncated Gamma, incomplete inverse-Gamma, benchmark, robust, hyper-g/n, and intrinsic priors. Through an integrated Laplace approximation, the posterior distribution of 1/(1 + g) is in turn a {tCCH} distribution, and approximate marginal likelihoods are thus available analytically, leading to “Compound Hypergeometric Information Criteria” for model selection. We discuss the local geometric properties of the g-prior in {GLMs} and show how the desiderata for model selection proposed by Bayarri et al., such as asymptotic model selection consistency, intrinsic consistency, and measurement invariance may be used to justify the prior and specific choices of the hyper parameters. We illustrate inference using these priors and contrast them to other approaches via simulation and real data examples.

	abstract = {Bayesian variable selection often assumes normality, but the effects of model misspecification are not sufficiently understood. There are sound reasons behind this assumption, particularly for large p: ease of interpretation, analytical, and computational convenience. More flexible frameworks exist, including semi- or nonparametric models, often at the cost of some tractability. We propose a simple extension that allows for skewness and thicker-than-normal tails but preserves tractability. It leads to easy interpretation and a log-concave likelihood that facilitates optimization and integration. We characterize asymptotically parameter estimation and Bayes factor rates, under certain model misspecification. Under suitable conditions, misspecified Bayes factors induce sparsity at the same rates than under the correct model. However, the rates to detect signal change by an exponential factor, often reducing sensitivity. These deficiencies can be ameliorated by inferring the error distribution, a simple strategy that can improve inference substantially. Our work focuses on the likelihood and can be combined with any likelihood penalty or prior, but here we focus on nonlocal priors to induce extra sparsity and ameliorate finite-sample effects caused by misspecification. We show the importance of considering the likelihood rather than solely the prior, for Bayesian variable selection.

In this article, we bridge this gap by crossfertilizing these two paradigms with the Spike-and-Slab {LASSO} procedure for variable selection and parameter estimation in linear regression. We introduce a new class of self-adaptive penalty functions that arise from a fully Bayes spike-and-slab formulation, ultimately moving beyond the separable penalty framework. A virtue of these nonseparable penalties is their ability to borrow strength across coordinates, adapt to ensemble sparsity information and exert multiplicity adjustment. The Spike-and-Slab {LASSO} procedure harvests efficient coordinate-wise implementations with a path-following scheme for dynamic posterior exploration. We show on simulated data that the fully Bayes penalty mimics oracle performance, providing a viable alternative to cross-validation. We develop theory for the separable and nonseparable variants of the penalty, showing rate-optimality of the global mode as well as optimal posterior concentration when p {\textgreater} n.

In this article, we take a Bayesian point of view on this problem and show how to construct priors on decision tree ensembles that are capable of adapting to sparsity in the predictors by placing a sparsity-inducing Dirichlet hyperprior on the splitting proportions of the regression tree prior. We characterize the asymptotic distribution of the number of predictors included in the model and show how this prior can be easily incorporated into existing Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes. We demonstrate that our approach yields useful posterior inclusion probabilities for each predictor and illustrate the usefulness of our approach relative to other decision tree ensemble approaches on both simulated and real datasets.

Models for the unconditional or conditional distribution function of any univariate response variable can be set up and estimated in the same theoretical and computational framework simply by choosing an appropriate transformation function and parameterization thereof. The ability to evaluate the distribution function directly allows us to estimate models based on the exact likelihood, especially in the presence of random censoring or truncation. For discrete and continuous responses, we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. A reference software implementation of maximum likelihood-based estimation for conditional transformation models that allows the same ﬂexibility as the theory developed here was employed to illustrate the wide range of possible applications.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the {FWER} when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the {FWER} is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

The methods employ ﬂexible piecewise constant or spline speciﬁcations for baseline hazard functions in either marginal or conditional {PH} models, along with assumptions about the association among lifetimes. Because the models are parametric, ordinary maximum likelihood can be applied; it is able to deal easily with such data features as interval censoring or sequentially observed lifetimes, unlike existing semiparametric methods. A bivariate Clayton model (1978, Biometrika 65, 141–151) is used to illustrate the approach taken. Because a parametric assumption about association is made, eﬃciency and robustness comparisons are made between estimation based on the bivariate Clayton model and “working independence” methods that specify only marginal distributions for each lifetime variable.},

	abstract = {Sequentially observed survival times are of interest in many studies but there are difficulties in analyzing such data using nonparametric or semiparametric methods. First, when the duration of followup is limited and the times for a given individual are not independent, induced dependent censoring arises for the second and subsequent survival times. Non-identifiability of the marginal survival distributions for second and later times is another issue, since they are observable only if preceding survival times for an individual are uncensored. In addition, in some studies a significant proportion of individuals may never have the first event. Fully parametric models can deal with these features, but robustness is a concern. We introduce a new approach to address these issues. We model the joint distribution of the successive survival times by using copula functions, and provide semiparametric estimation procedures in which copula parameters are estimated without parametric assumptions on the marginal distributions. This provides more robust estimates and checks on the fit of parametric models. The methodology is applied to a motivating example involving relapse and survival following colon cancer treatment.},
