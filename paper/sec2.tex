Here is some additional text and we can also reference a table (see table \ref{Ta:a_table}).  The incivility was the sum of features present within a block \cite{costa_case_2017}.

\subsection*{Copula regression}

This is a whole section on copula regression
\begin{gather}
E(Z(s))=\mu(s)=\mu,\text{for all }s \in D \label{E:2.1}\\
Var(Z(s))=\sigma^{2}(s)=\sigma^{2},\text{for all }s \in D \label{E:2.2}\\
Cov(Z(s_{1}),Z(s_{2}))=C(s_{i}-s_{j}),\text{for all }s_{i}\ne s_{j} \in D \label{E:2.3}
\end{gather}
Equations \ref{E:2.1} and \ref{E:2.2} ensure that the mean and variance are constant and independent of location throughout the region $D$. Equation \ref{E:2.3} ensures that the covariance depends only on the difference between two locations, rather than the locations themselves. $C(\cdot)$ in equation \ref{E:2.3} is called the covariance function.

 (\cite{smith_bayesian_nodate}, \cite{biswas_bayesian_2009}).  
 
 We use the R package ``copula" \cite{hofert_copula:_2016}.
